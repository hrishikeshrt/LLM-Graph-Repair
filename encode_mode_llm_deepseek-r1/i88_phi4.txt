The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the fact that a patient cannot start taking a medication on December 27, 1968, as this date is before their birth. Therefore, the relationship indicating the patient started taking Epoetin alfa must be incorrect or misdated.

To address this factual inconsistency, we should remove the erroneous `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship from the graph. The allergy information can remain unchanged unless further context suggests it's also incorrect.
