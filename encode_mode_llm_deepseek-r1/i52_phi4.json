This correction is made because February 14, 1941, would make the patient over 80 years old as of 2023, which seems unlikely given the context of taking Coumadin (a medication often prescribed for conditions like atrial fibrillation or after certain surgeries). The updated birthdate suggests a more plausible age range for such a prescription.",
