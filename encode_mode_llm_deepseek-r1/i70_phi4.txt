Based on the inconsistency described, it seems there are two main issues:

1. The `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient "epoetin alfa" may be incorrect.
2. The medication start and end dates being May 4, 1975, is likely an error.

Here are the suggested repairs to address these inconsistencies:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | m | {start_date: 'correct_start_date', end_date: 'correct_end_date'}
</repairs>

Note: Replace `'correct_start_date'` and `'correct_end_date'` with the actual correct dates for the medication. If these are not known, they should be verified from a reliable source before making this update.
