To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient's allergic reaction aligns with their medication and ingredients. The issue arises because the patient has an allergy to an ingredient in a medication they took, which is labeled as causing an allergic reaction.

Here are the suggested repairs:

1. **Remove the incorrect allergy relationship** between the patient and the ingredient, since it should not exist if the patient's allergy is due to the medication itself rather than directly to the ingredient.

2. **Update the medication's properties** to correctly reflect that the allergic reaction is associated with the medication code '860975', not just the ingredient.
