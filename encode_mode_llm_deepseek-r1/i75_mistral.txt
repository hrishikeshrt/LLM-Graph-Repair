The above repairs suggest the following changes to fix the inconsistency:
- Add a relationship `rm` between the patient and the medication, as the patient is taking the medication.
- Add a relationship `rc` from the medication to the ingredient, since the medication contains the ingredient.
- Update the properties of the medication node with its name and code.
- Update the label of the ingredient node to 'Ingredient', as it should be labeled as an ingredient instead of just having a name 'Ingredient'.
