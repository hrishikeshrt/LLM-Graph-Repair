Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        
The graph describes a relationship between a **Patient** (address: 935 Rempel Trail, birthdate: 1923-06-22), their medication (code: 205923, description: "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection"), and an ingredient (tau_o: 1). The **Patient** is taking the medication from a start time of 2013-08-11T09:55:43Z to a stop time of 2013-08-11T09:55:43Z. Additionally, there is an **ALLERGIC_TO** relationship between the **Patient** and the medication, indicating that the medication contains an ingredient causing an allergic reaction.

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
