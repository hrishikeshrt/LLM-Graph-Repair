Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        
The graph consists of three nodes: a Patient (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5996) with address 170 Kerluke Extension Suite 51 and birthdate May 23, 1942; a Medication (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750) described as "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet"; and an Ingredient (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691) associated with "ferrous sulfate".

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
