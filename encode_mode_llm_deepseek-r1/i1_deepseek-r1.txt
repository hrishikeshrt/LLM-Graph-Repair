Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on.

From the description, there are two relationships from the patient (p) to an ingredient (i). One is through rm:TAKES_MEDICATION, and the other is through ra:ALLERGIC_TO. The medication taken is HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet, which has 'exemestane' as one of its ingredients.

Wait a minute, I remember that exemestane is actually an anti-estrogen, not an estrogen. So if someone is taking a medication with exemestane and they have an ALLERGIC_TO relationship pointing to it, that might be incorrect because the allergy information should relate to the correct ingredient.

So looking at the code, the ra:ALLERGIC_TO relationship connects p to i. But since i has 'exemestane', which is a different class of medication (anti-estrogen), having an allergy here doesn't make sense. The patient might have allergies related to other ingredients in the medication, not necessarily because they're allergic to exemestane.

Therefore, I think we should remove the ra:ALLERGIC_TO relationship from i. That way, the graph won't incorrectly associate the patient's allergies with an ingredient that doesn't belong there.
