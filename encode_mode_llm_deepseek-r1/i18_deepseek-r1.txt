Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, there's a problem with the medication data linked through the 'has_ingredient' relationship.

The description says that Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection is taken by the patient and has an ingredient called oxycodone. But wait, isn't oxycodone more commonly associated with oxycodone/hydrocodone pills rather than injectable substances? Maybe that's where the issue lies.

Looking at the graph structure, there are two relationships from the medication node: one to 'has_ingredient' and another to 'allergic_to'. The problem is probably that the 'has_ingredient' relationship incorrectly links to oxycodone for an injectable medication. So, I should remove this incorrect edge.

So, the solution would be to delete the existing 'has_ingredient' relationship between the medication node and oxycodone.
