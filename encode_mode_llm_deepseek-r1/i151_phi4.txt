The inconsistency described involves a patient, Teddy976, who has been prescribed Metformin and has an allergy to it. The medication contains Metformin as an ingredient, which contradicts the fact that the patient is allergic to it.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen. This can be achieved by deleting the edge between the patient and the medication.
