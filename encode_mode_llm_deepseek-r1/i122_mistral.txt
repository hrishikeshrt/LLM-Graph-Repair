Explanation: The patient is allergic to an ingredient, but the medication they take contains that same ingredient. To resolve this inconsistency, we need to update the allergenic property of the ingredient node to false (meaning it's not allergenic) and delete the relationship between the patient and the ingredient. This change ensures that the patient is no longer allergic to the ingredient in question.
