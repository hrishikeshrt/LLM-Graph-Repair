This implies that the patient's allergy condition might not be effectively managed by this medication alone, especially if it aligns with their known allergen.\n\nTo address potential factual inaccuracies:\n- The `allergy_medication_start_date` and `end_date` properties of the Patient node are updated to reflect the brief usage period. This could indicate a need for further evaluation or alternative treatments.\n- No changes are made to the relationships (`TAKES_MEDICATION`, `HAS_INGREDIENT`, `ALLERGIC_TO`) themselves, as they accurately represent the connections between entities.\n\nThis update ensures that the graph reflects the patient's medication history accurately and highlights potential issues with their allergy management.",
