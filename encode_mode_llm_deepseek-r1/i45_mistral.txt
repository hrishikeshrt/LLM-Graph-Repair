Explanation:

* UPD_NODE operation updates the allergy property of the Ingredient node to indicate that it is not an allergen for the patient.
* ADD_EDGE operation adds a new relationship between the Patient and Medication nodes, indicating that the patient took the medication on August 30, 1986.
* DEL_EDGE operation removes the existing relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes, as the allergen issue was related to the medication, not the ingredient itself.
