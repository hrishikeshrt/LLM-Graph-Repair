The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves a patient being allergic to an ingredient that is part of a medication they are taking. Specifically, the patient is taking Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which contains oxycodone as an ingredient, and the patient is also listed as allergic to oxycodone.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to address the relationship indicating the patient's allergy to an ingredient present in their medication. Since it is generally unsafe for a patient to take a medication containing an allergen, one possible factual correction would be:

1. Remove the relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to oxycodone if the allergy information is incorrect or outdated.
2. Alternatively, if the allergy information is correct and the medication should not contain oxycodone, remove the relationship between the medication and the ingredient.

Given these options, here are two possible sets of repairs:

**Option 1: If the allergy information is incorrect**
