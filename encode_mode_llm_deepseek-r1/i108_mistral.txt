   UPD_NODE | (i:Ingredient {name: "oxycodone"}) | {code: "-", description: "-"}
   ADD_EDGE | (m:Medication)-[:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i)
   </repairs>

   This repair suggests updating the ingredient node with no code and description as it is not relevant for an ingredient. Then, a new relationship between the medication and the updated ingredient node is added to reflect the correct information.
