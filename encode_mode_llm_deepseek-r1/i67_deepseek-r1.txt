Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what's going on here.

The user provided a Cypher query that matches a patient taking medication and having an allergic reaction. The problem is about inconsistent information with the same ingredient. 

Looking at the code, the patient (6465) takes medication 6846, which has an active space of 1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. Then, there's an allergy to ingredient 6847: epoetin alfa.

Wait a minute, Epogen and Epoetin Alfa are different things. So having both in the same allergy doesn't make sense. That's probably where the inconsistency lies.

So, I need to remove either the allergy or the medication's active space that refers to the incorrect ingredient. 

I can choose to delete the edge [rc] which connects the medication to the ingredient 6847. Alternatively, maybe update the medication's details to correct the active space.

But since the user wants a minimal repair, deleting the edge seems straightforward and quick.
