The Patient (probably named Logan497) was taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, which contains the ingredient mestranol. Mestranol is also a substance to which the patient is allergic. The patient began taking the medication on November 11, 1983, and stopped it on December 16, 1983. However, there is an error indicating that mestranol should not be part of this medication for this patient.
