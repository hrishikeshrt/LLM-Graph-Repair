This situation should not occur unless there's an error in recording either the allergy or medication data.\n\nTo resolve this, we need to determine whether the allergy information is incorrect (i.e., the patient is not actually allergic to \"Epogen\") or if the medication information is incorrect (i.e., the patient should not be taking a medication containing \"Epogen\").\n\nAssuming that the allergy information is correct and the issue lies with the medication, we can remove the relationship between the medication and the ingredient. This assumes there's an error in associating \"Epogen\" as an ingredient of the medication.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\n</repairs> \n\nThis operation removes the incorrect association between the medication and the ingredient, resolving the inconsistency while preserving the patient's allergy information.",
