This graph represents a patient's medication details along with their allergies and medical history. 

- **Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757** is labeled as an **Ingredient**, indicating it contains the word "Ingredient" in its description.

- **Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846** is labeled as a **Medication**, with detailed properties including the medication name, code (205923), and description ("1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection").

The relationships between these nodes are as follows:

- **Edge 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757** indicates that **this medication has an ingredient**, with a possible error noted in the properties.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
