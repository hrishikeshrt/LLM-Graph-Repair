Given that an allergic reaction to a medication ingredient can be critical information, it would be prudent to remove this ambiguous relationship.\n\n```xml\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [ra] | -\n</repairs>\n```\n\nThis repair operation removes the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the Patient and Ingredient (mestranol) due to its incomplete date information. This ensures that only well-defined allergy statuses are represented in the graph.",
