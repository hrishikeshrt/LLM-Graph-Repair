The inconsistency in this graph pattern arises from the fact that the patient is allergic to Humulin, yet they are taking a medication (Humulin 70/30) that contains an ingredient of which they are not directly allergic. The allergy should be associated with mestranol, not Humulin itself.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the direct allergy relationship from the patient to Humulin.
2. Ensure the allergy is correctly linked to mestranol.
