Given the inconsistency, I suggest the following repairs:

<repairs>
ADD_NODE | i | {code: 'SOMETHING', description: 'A substance'} </repairs>
ADD_EDGE | [rc] | {ingredient: 'SOMETHING'} 
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

These suggested repairs address the inconsistency by adding a new ingredient with properties and updating its relationship to the medication.
