The inconsistency in the graph is that the Medication node has an edge labeled `ALLERGIC_TO` pointing to an Ingredient, which suggests that the medication itself is allergic to an ingredient. This is illogical because medications cannot be allergic to ingredients; rather, patients can be allergic to ingredients.

To fix this inconsistency, we need to remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship from the Medication node and ensure it correctly points from the Patient node to the Ingredient node, which already exists in the graph pattern provided. 

Here are the suggested repairs:
