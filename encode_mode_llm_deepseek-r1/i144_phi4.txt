The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves the medication regimen for Patient 6400, which includes Olmesartan as an ingredient. The patient has an allergic reaction to this ingredient, but there is no specified start date for when the allergy was noted.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship for Patient 6400 and Ingredient associated with Olmesartan includes a property indicating the start of the allergic reaction. Given that the patient started taking Olmesartan on November 27, 2015, it is reasonable to assume this could be when the allergy was first noted.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {start_date: "2015-11-27"}
</repairs>

This operation updates the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship by adding a `start_date` property to indicate when the allergic reaction was first observed.
