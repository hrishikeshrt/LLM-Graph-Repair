Since no specific inconsistency was provided, I'll create a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate how to suggest repairs.

Let's assume we have an inconsistency in the graph where the patient (p) has multiple addresses, but only one address is linked to the patient through the `ADDRESS` property. We also want to add the birthdate and deathdate properties to the patient node.

Inconsistent Cypher query:
```cypher
MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)
RETURN p.address, p.birthdate, p.deathdate
```
Textual description of the graph pattern corresponding to the inconsistency:

The `ADDRESS` property is linked to a single address node, but we want to add additional properties (birthdate and deathdate) to the patient node.

Suggested repairs:
```cypher
<repairs>
ADD_NODE | p | {birthdate: '1990-01-01', deathdate: '2022-01-01'}
ADD_EDGE | p | [rm]
ADD_NODE | m | -
ADD_EDGE | m | [rc]
ADD_EDGE | p | [address]
</repairs>
```
