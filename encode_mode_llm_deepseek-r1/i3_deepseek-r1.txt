Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The description says there's a patient who took a medication called "exemestane," but the record shows that the patient is allergic to the same ingredient "exemestane." That doesn't make sense because if they're taking it, they shouldn't be allergic. So, this seems contradictory.

Looking at the graph structure: The patient (p) takes a medication (m), which has an ingredient (i). There's also a relationship [ra] from p to i indicating allergy. But since the medication contains "exemestane," and the patient is taking it, having both [rm] and [ra] should be incorrect.

So, I think we need to remove either the [rm] or [rc] relationships where "exemestane" is involved. That way, if the patient is taking the medication, they shouldn't have an allergy to its ingredient.

I'll go with removing the [rc] relationship because it's directly connecting the medication to the ingredient, and since the medication contains "exemestane," having both would be inconsistent.
