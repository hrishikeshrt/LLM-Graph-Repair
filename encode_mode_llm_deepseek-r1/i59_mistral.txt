   UPD_NODE | [i] | {allergen: 'ferrous sulfate', allergy_type: 'allergic'}
   </repairs>
   This repair updates the properties of the Ingredient node to reflect that it causes an allergic reaction. It does not remove any existing relationships as the information about the patient being allergic to ferrous sulfate may still be relevant, but it needs to be updated to accurately represent the allergy type.
