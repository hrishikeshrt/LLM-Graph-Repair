   The first repair operation removes the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient, as the medication should not be allergic to an ingredient it contains. The second repair operation updates the Ingredient node with the correct code for the medication. The third repair operation adds a new HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between the Ingredient node and the Medication node, indicating that the medication does indeed contain this ingredient.
