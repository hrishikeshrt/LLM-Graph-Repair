To fix this, we first update the node for the Medication (HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet) to correctly include hydrochlorothiazide as an ingredient. Next, we remove the edge between the Patient and Ingredient nodes that represents the allergy. Finally, since the patient started taking this medication on January 2, 1989, and stopped on January 8, 1990, we add a new TAKES_MEDICATION relationship for these dates and update its properties accordingly.",
