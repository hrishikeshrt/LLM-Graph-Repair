The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises because the patient, Kerlupe267, who was allergic to mestranol, should not be taking a medication that contains this allergen. The relationship `[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)` indicates an allergy to mestranol, while the path `(p)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i)` shows the patient is taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, which contains mestranol.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes a medication containing an allergen they are allergic to. This can be achieved by deleting the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient and the medication.
