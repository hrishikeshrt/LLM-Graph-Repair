Explanation of the repair:
- The inconsistency arises because a patient (Shanahan202) is allergic to "Metformin", but the allergy should be to the ingredient "Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" contained in Metformin.
- Therefore, the relationship indicating an allergy to "Metformin" itself should be removed.
