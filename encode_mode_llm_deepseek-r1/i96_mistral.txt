   UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {allergen: "-"}
   </repairs>
   It seems that the allergy information for the patient and ingredient is incorrectly set. To fix this, we should update the `ra` relationship to remove the allergen property. Since there's no specific allergen mentioned in the given description, I assumed that the allergen property should be removed.
