The inconsistency identified is that Brekke496 has an allergy to Epogen, which is listed as an allergen. However, Epogen should not be directly related to the medication ingredients since it is a separate medication and not an ingredient of Oxycodone.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect allergic relationship between Brekke496 and Epogen.
