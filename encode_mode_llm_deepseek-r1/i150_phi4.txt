The inconsistency described involves a patient who is taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic. This situation is problematic because it implies a potential health risk for the patient.

To address this, we can consider two possible repairs:

1. **Remove the allergy relationship**: If the allergy information is incorrect or if the patient has been cleared of the allergy, removing the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship would resolve the inconsistency.

2. **Update the medication history to reflect discontinuation due to allergy**: If the medication was discontinued because of the allergy, updating the medication history to reflect this reason would be appropriate.

Here are the suggested repairs:
