To determine the necessary repairs, we need to analyze the provided graph pattern and identify any factual inconsistencies based on the textual description.

1. **Patient's Lifespan**: The patient was born on May 7, 1917, and passed away on January 23, 2018. This means that any medication taken by the patient should fall within this date range.

2. **Medication Timeline**: Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension was taken from November 21, 2005, to March 6, 2006. This period is within the patient's lifespan, so there is no inconsistency here regarding the timeline of medication intake.

3. **Ingredient Information**: Mestrano is listed as an ingredient in Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension. We need to verify if this information is correct.

4. **Allergy Information**: The graph pattern indicates that the patient is allergic to Mestrano, which is found in the medication they took. This could be a factual inconsistency if the patient was not actually allergic to Mestrano or if Humulin 70/30 does not contain Mestrano as an ingredient.

Given these points, let's consider potential repairs:

- If Mestrano is indeed not an ingredient of Humulin 70/30, we need to remove the relationship `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]` between `Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension` and `Mestrano`.

- If the patient is not allergic to Mestrano, we need to remove the relationship `[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]` between the patient and `Mestrano`.

Assuming both the ingredient information and allergy information are incorrect based on factual data:
