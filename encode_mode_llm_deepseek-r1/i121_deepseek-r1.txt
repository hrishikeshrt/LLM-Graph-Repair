Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

The description says that a patient is taking a medication called "Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," which has an ingredient "oxycodone." The patient developed an allergy to oxycodone starting on May 13, 2017, so they had to stop taking the medication on that date.

Looking at the graph query, there are two relationships from the patient node: one to the medication (rm) and another to the ingredient (ra). The medication has an ingredient relationship (rc) pointing to oxycodone. 

The issue here is that the allergy was developed towards oxycodone, which is part of the medication's ingredients. So, the current graph only shows the patient taking the medication via rm, but the allergy is directly linked to the ingredient.

I think we need to adjust how these relationships are structured. Instead of having a separate relationship from the patient to the medication (rm), maybe it should be directly connected through the ingredient. That way, both the medication and the allergy are linked correctly.

So, I'll remove the rm edge so that the patient is only connected via the ra edge to the ingredient. Then, since the medication's ingredient isn't necessary for this specific case because the allergy is already tied to oxycodone, we can delete the rc relationship from the medication node pointing to oxycodone.

This should fix the inconsistency by correctly linking the allergy directly to the ingredient without involving the entire medication.
