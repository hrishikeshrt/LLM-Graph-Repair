The inconsistency described involves a patient who is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. The relationship `ALLERGIC_TO` between the patient and the ingredient should not exist if it's safe for them to take the medication containing that ingredient.

To resolve this, we need to remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient (6400) and the ingredient (6660).
