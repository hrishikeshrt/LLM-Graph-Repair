The inconsistency described involves a patient being allergic to an ingredient ('oxycodone') associated with a medication they are taking, and also being allergic to the medication itself. Additionally, there's an issue with the patient starting and stopping the medication on the same date.

To address these inconsistencies:

1. **Remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the medication** since it is more logical for the patient to be allergic to the ingredient rather than the entire medication.
2. **Correct the start and stop dates for taking the medication**, assuming that if they started and stopped on the same date, it might indicate an error in recording.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | (m) | {start_date: '2003-03-08', stop_date: '2003-03-09'}
</repairs> 

Note: The second repair assumes that the patient should have been taking the medication for at least one day, so the stop date is adjusted to be one day after the start date. Adjust as necessary based on additional context or requirements.
