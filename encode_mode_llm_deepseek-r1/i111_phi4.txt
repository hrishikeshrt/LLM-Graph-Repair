The inconsistency arises because the patient is allergic to an ingredient that is part of a medication they are taking. This situation should not occur unless there's an error in recording either the allergy or medication data.

To resolve this, we need to determine whether the allergy information is incorrect (i.e., the patient is not actually allergic to "Epogen") or if the medication information is incorrect (i.e., the patient should not be taking a medication containing "Epogen").

Assuming that the allergy information is correct and the issue lies with the medication, we can remove the relationship between the medication and the ingredient. This assumes there's an error in associating "Epogen" as an ingredient of the medication.

Here are the suggested repairs:
