The Patient (Walker122), with address 524 Brekke Dale Suite 9 and birthdate September 6, 1914, takes a medication identified as 'Epogen' on November 21, 1972.

Additionally, there appears to be an error in the allergen relationship with another entity, which does not affect the current medication details.
