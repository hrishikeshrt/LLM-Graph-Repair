The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises because a patient is noted to be allergic to an ingredient that is part of a medication they are taking. This situation suggests either incorrect allergy data or incorrect prescription data.

To resolve this, one potential factual correction could involve removing the relationship indicating the patient's allergy to the ingredient since it contradicts the fact that the patient is prescribed and taking the medication containing that ingredient. However, if the allergy information is accurate, then there might be a need for further medical consultation rather than an immediate graph repair.

Given the data provided, here are the suggested repairs:

This operation removes the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient, assuming that the prescription should not include ingredients to which the patient is allergic. If this assumption does not hold true, further medical verification would be needed before making such a change in the graph data.
