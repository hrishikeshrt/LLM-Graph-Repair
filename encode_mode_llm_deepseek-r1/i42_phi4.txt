The inconsistency described involves a patient who has an allergy to an ingredient in a medication they are taking, but there's no mention of any allergic reaction occurring or being resolved. The fact that the allergy stopped on April 4, 1983, suggests that the relationship indicating the allergy should not exist if it was resolved before the patient started taking the medication.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship indicating the allergy since it is no longer relevant after the specified date.
