The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from a patient being allergic to an ingredient that is part of their medication regimen. Specifically, the patient is taking mestranol and is also noted as allergic to an unspecified allergen related to Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension. This implies a potential error where the allergy relationship should not exist if the allergen is unrelated to the medication's ingredients.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. **Remove the incorrect allergy relationship**: Since there is no specific allergen identified for Humulin 70/30 and it does not contain mestranol, the patient should not be allergic to an unspecified ingredient of this medication.
