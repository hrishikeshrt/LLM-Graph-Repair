      UPD_NODE | [i] | {name: "chlorthalidone", allergy: "false"}
      ADD_EDGE | [p, i] | {allergic_to: false}
   </repairs>

   This repair suggests updating the property of the Ingredient node (`i`) to set its allergy status to `false`. Additionally, it adds a new edge from the Patient node (`p`) to the Ingredient node (`i`) with an allergic_to property of `false`. This repair assumes that Cassandra224 is no longer allergic to chlorthalidone. If this assumption is incorrect, further repairs may be necessary.
