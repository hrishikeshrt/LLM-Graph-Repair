The inconsistency arises because a medication like "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" should not be an ingredient of another entity in this context. Instead, it should have its own ingredients. The relationship `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i)` is likely incorrect as it implies the medication itself is an ingredient rather than containing one.

To fix this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the medication and the ingredient.
2. Ensure that the patient's allergy to the ingredient remains intact, as this information is correct.
