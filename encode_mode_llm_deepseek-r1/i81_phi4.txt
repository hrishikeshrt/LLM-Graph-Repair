The inconsistency arises from the fact that the patient is allergic to an ingredient, Epogen, which is contained in a medication they are taking. This situation poses a potential health risk and should be addressed.

To resolve this issue:

1. Remove the relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to the ingredient Epogen.
2. Ensure that the medication's ingredients are correctly recorded, although based on the description provided, it appears correct.

This operation removes the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient Epogen. This assumes that the allergy information is incorrect or needs to be updated elsewhere in the system. If further investigation confirms the allergy, alternative actions such as updating medication plans should be considered outside this repair scope.
