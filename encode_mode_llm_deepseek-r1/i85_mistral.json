However, the medication's ingredient is specified as epoetin alfa (code 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93'). Since the patient is allergic to this ingredient, it should not be part of the medication they are taking. Therefore, we update the `rc` edge to remove the ingredient property. Additionally, since the ingredient node's code remains the same for the allergy relationship, we also update the node with the correct code.",
