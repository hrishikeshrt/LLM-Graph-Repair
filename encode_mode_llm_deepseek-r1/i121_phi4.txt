To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient's allergy and medication-taking timeline are accurately reflected in the graph. The patient developed an allergy to "oxycodone" on May 13, 2017, and should have discontinued taking "Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" from that date.

Here are the suggested repairs:

1. Ensure there is a property indicating when the patient discontinued the medication due to the allergy.
2. If necessary, add or update properties related to the allergy start date.

UPD_EDGE | [rm] | {discontinued: "2017-05-13"}
