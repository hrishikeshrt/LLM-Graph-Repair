The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that a patient who is allergic to an ingredient should not be taking medication containing that ingredient. In this case, the patient is taking "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," which contains "epoetin alfa," and they are also allergic to "epoetin alfa."

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen.
