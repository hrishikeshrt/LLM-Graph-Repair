To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient's allergy information aligns with the medication ingredients. The inconsistency arises because the patient is allergic to mestranol, an ingredient in Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

Explanation:
- `DEL_EDGE` is used to remove the incorrect allergy relationship `[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]` between the patient and mestranol, as it should not exist if Humulin 70/30 does not contain mestranol.
