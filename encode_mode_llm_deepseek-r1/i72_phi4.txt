The inconsistency in this scenario arises from a patient being allergic to an ingredient found in a medication they are taking. The specific problem involves the allergy starting on April 28, 1967, which seems implausible for a living person unless they were born before that date.

To address this inconsistency, we need to verify if it is more likely that the allergy information is incorrect or needs updating. Since an allergy cannot start in the past relative to a patient's birthdate (assuming the patient was not born on April 28, 1967), the logical repair would be to remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship.
