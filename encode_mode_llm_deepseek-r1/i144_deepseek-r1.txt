Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From what's given, a Patient named 6400 is taking a medication called Olmesartan with some ingredients, including another drug called HCTZ. But there's an issue: the ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the Patient and the Ingredient (HCTZ) isn't specifying when it started. The medication was taken from November 27, 2015, to February 26, 2016, but the allergy info is just present without a start date.

So, in the graph, there's an edge [ra:ALLERGIC_TO] between the Patient and the Ingredient. The problem here is that this edge doesn't have any additional properties like when it started or ended. 

I think adding a property to indicate the start time would fix this inconsistency because it provides necessary information about when the allergy began. So, I'll add the 'started' property with the value '2015-11-27'.

Looking at the structure of the graph query, the edge [ra:ALLERGIC_TO] is between (p) and (i). Therefore, to modify this edge, I should use the UPD_EDGE operation on [ra].

So, the repair would involve updating the edge with the 'started' property. That way, the inconsistency of missing start date for the allergy is addressed.
