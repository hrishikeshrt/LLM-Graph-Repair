The inconsistency arises because Oxycodone should not be an ingredient of Epogen. Therefore, we need to remove the incorrect relationship between Epogen and Oxycodone as an ingredient.

```xml
<repairs>
    DEL_EDGE | [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT {from: 6846, to: <Oxycodone Node ID>}] | -
</repairs>
```

Note: Replace `<Oxycodone Node ID>` with the actual node ID of Oxycodone in your graph.
