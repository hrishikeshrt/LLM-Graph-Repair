This repair suggests updating the ingredient node with the correct code and name, removing the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient. The assumption here is that the patient has an allergy to metformin in general rather than specifically to "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG". If the patient only has an allergy to the specific medication, a separate node for the medication should be created with the appropriate properties and the allergy relationship established between the patient and that node.
