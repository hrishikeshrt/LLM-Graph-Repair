Explanation: The patient is taking a medication that contains the allergen. To address this inconsistency, we need to update the end date of the medication and the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship for the patient, so it reflects ongoing use instead of a single dose. Additionally, we create a new node for the substance containing the allergen, establish an ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient and the new substance, and update the end date of the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship to reflect that the medication is still in use.
