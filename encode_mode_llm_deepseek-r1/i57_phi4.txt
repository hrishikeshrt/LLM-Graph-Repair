    DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -  <!-- Remove the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship as the patient stopped taking it before experiencing an allergic reaction -->
</repairs>
``` 

This repair operation addresses the inconsistency by removing the `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge, reflecting that the patient ceased medication use prior to the allergic reaction. The allergy and ingredient relationships remain valid since they exist independently of the medication-taking timeline.
