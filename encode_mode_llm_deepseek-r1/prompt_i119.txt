The graph represents a relationship between a patient (Patient), medication (Medication), and an ingredient (Ingredient). 

1. **Patient**: The patient has the ID `3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d`, is named "Sanford861", was born on June 22, 1923, and resides at "935 Rempel Trail". 

2. **Medication**: The medication has the ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846`, is described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection", and starts being taken on August 8, 2017.

3. **Ingredient**: The ingredient has the ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757` and is labeled "oxycodone".

The relationships are as follows:

- The medication (`e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846`) contains the ingredient `oxycodone` (as indicated by the edge with ID `5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036`).
- The patient (`e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840`) is taking the medication, as shown by the edge with ID `5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:985`.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
