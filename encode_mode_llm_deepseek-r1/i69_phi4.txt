The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises because the patient is taking a medication that contains an allergen to which they are allergic. This situation suggests either:

1. The patient should not be taking this medication due to their allergy.
2. The ingredient information might be incorrect.

To address this, we can choose one of these approaches:

### Approach 1: Remove the Medication Relationship
If the patient should not be taking the medication due to the allergen, remove the relationship indicating that they are taking it.

### Approach 2: Correct Ingredient Information
If the ingredient information is incorrect and the patient can safely take the medication without an allergic reaction, remove the allergy relationship or correct the ingredient details.

Option A: Remove the allergy relationship if there's no actual allergy.

Option B: Correct the ingredient if it was incorrectly labeled as Epogen.
- This would require additional information about what the correct ingredient should be, which is not provided here.

Choose one of these approaches based on the context or available data.
