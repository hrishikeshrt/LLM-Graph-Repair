   UPD_NODE | [p] | {allergy_info: "-"}
   </repairs>

   The given graph represents a patient who is allergic to an ingredient of the medication they are taking. However, the text description suggests that the allergy information might be incorrect. To fix this inconsistency, we update the properties of the `Patient` node (target: [p]) by removing the allergy information (details: {allergy_info: "-"}). This repair operation assumes that the patient is not actually allergic to any ingredient in their medication.
