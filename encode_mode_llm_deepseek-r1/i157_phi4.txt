Based on the provided description, there are a few potential issues that need addressing:

1. **Allergy to an Ingredient in Medication**: The patient is allergic to ferrous sulfate, which is an ingredient of the medication they are taking. This suggests a potential health risk.

2. **Operational Errors with Ingredient and Medication Nodes**: These errors could relate to incorrect properties or missing information that needs correction.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | m:Medication {id: 860975} | - // Ensure correct medication details
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | i:Ingredient {name: "ferrous sulfate"} | - // Verify ingredient properties
</repairs>

These operations address the immediate risk by stopping the patient from taking a medication containing an allergen and ensure that both the medication and ingredient nodes have accurate information.
