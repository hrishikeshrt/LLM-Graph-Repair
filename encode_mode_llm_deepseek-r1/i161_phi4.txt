To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient's allergy to ferrous sulfate aligns with their medication intake history. The issue arises because the patient has an allergic reaction to an ingredient in a medication they took within the timeframe of February 22, 1992, to March 14, 1992.

Given this scenario, it is likely incorrect for the patient to have been prescribed a medication containing an allergen during that period. Therefore, we should remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication with ferrous sulfate.

Here are the suggested repairs:
