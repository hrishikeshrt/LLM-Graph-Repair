   The first repair updates the ingredient node's properties to reflect that Walker122 is allergic to it. The second repair removes the allergy relationship between Walker122 and the original ingredient (as they are now allergic to each other). The third repair adds a new allergy relationship between Walker122 and the updated ingredient node.
