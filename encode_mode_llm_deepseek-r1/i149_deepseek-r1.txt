Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The original code has a match pattern that connects a patient (p) to a medication (m), which then connects to an ingredient (i). There are two relationships: rm for taking medication and rc for having an ingredient, plus ra indicating an allergy between p and i. The problem is with the allergy relationship because the patient started and stopped the medication on specific dates.

Hmm, so if the patient took the medication from September 17 to November 12, that means they were allergic during that time but not before or after. So the existing ra edge probably only exists for those months. But in the current graph, is the ra relationship always present? Or maybe it's missing parts of the timeline.

Looking at the example outputs, one approach was deleting an edge when it shouldn't be there anymore. Maybe I need to adjust which edges are present based on the medication period.

So perhaps the solution is to remove the ra relationship except for the period when the medication was taken. That way, during the medication period (September 17 - November 12), the ra edge exists, and it's removed outside of that time frame.

I think using DEL_EDGE makes sense here because we're removing parts of an existing relationship based on a condition related to the start and end dates. The target would be [ra], and since no properties are changing beyond the deletion, details can just say '-'.
