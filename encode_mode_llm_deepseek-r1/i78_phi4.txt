The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern suggests that a patient who takes a medication and has an allergic reaction to one of its ingredients should not be prescribed that same medication. The presence of both `TAKES_MEDICATION` and `ALLERGIC_TO` relationships indicates a potential risk, as it implies the patient is taking a medication they are allergic to.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to address the prescription aspect by removing the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication in question. This ensures the patient's safety by preventing them from being prescribed a medication containing an allergen.

Here are the suggested repairs:
