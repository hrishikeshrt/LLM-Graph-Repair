The inconsistency described involves a medication that started and stopped on the same day, which suggests an error in the recorded dates. To address this, we can update the start or stop date of the relationship to reflect a more realistic scenario.

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rm] | {"start_date": "2020-01-13T09:55:00"}
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rm] | {"end_date": null}
</repairs> 

These operations ensure that the medication is recorded as ongoing, removing the erroneous stop date.
