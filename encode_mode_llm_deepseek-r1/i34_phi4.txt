The inconsistency in this case arises from a patient being both taking an ingredient and having an allergy to another medication that contains the same ingredient. This suggests a potential error in linking either the patient's medication or their allergies, as it is unusual for someone to be prescribed something they are allergic to.

To resolve this issue, we need to determine whether the patient is indeed allergic to the specific ingredient "Epogen" or if there was an incorrect link between the allergy and the medication containing that ingredient. Assuming the allergy information is correct (as it often is more critical), we should remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes a medication with this allergen.

Here are the suggested repairs:

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs> 

This operation removes the edge `[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]` between the patient and the medication, thereby breaking the chain of relationships leading to the inconsistency. This assumes that there is no other valid reason for the patient to take this medication despite their allergy, or that the prescription should be reviewed by a healthcare professional.
