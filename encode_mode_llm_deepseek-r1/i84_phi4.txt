Based on the description, there are two potential inconsistencies:

1. Walker122 is allergic to an ingredient that is part of a medication they take.
2. The start date for taking the medication seems unusually early (March 9, 1973).

To address these issues, we can suggest the following repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | p:Patient {name: 'Walker122'} | {medication_start_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'} 
</repairs>

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

Note: Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with a plausible start date for taking the medication.
