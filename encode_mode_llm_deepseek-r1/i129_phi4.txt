The inconsistency described involves a patient who is allergic to an ingredient present in a medication they are taking. This situation could potentially be harmful, and it suggests that either the allergy information or the medication prescription needs adjustment.

To resolve this issue, we have two main options:

1. **Remove the relationship indicating the patient is allergic to the ingredient** if it's determined that the allergy information is incorrect.
2. **Remove the relationship between the medication and the ingredient** if the medication should not contain that ingredient due to the patient's allergy.

Given the context, it seems more appropriate to address the prescription issue by ensuring the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen they are allergic to. Therefore, we will remove the relationship indicating the medication contains the allergenic ingredient.

Here is the suggested repair:
