   UPD_NODE | [p] | {allergy: "Epoetin alfa"}
   DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
   </repairs>

Explanation: The patient is allergic to Epoetin alfa, but the graph shows that they are not. To fix this inconsistency, we update the patient node's allergy property with "Epoetin alfa" and remove the relationship connecting the patient to Epoetin alfa medication.
