Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me see what's going on here.

From the description, there's a patient who took a medication with code 205923. This medication has an ingredient called oxycodone and also has an allergen. The medication started on April 24, 2016.

Looking at the graph query, I see that the patient is connected to a medication via `TAKES_MEDICATION`, which then connects to ingredients via `HAS_INGREDIENT`. There's also an `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient. 

Wait, so if the medication has an allergen in its ingredients, shouldn't the `ALLERGIC_TO` be on the medication instead of the ingredient? Because the allergy is related to the medication, not just a single ingredient.

In the current graph, the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship points from the patient to the ingredient. That might be incorrect because the allergen should be part of the medication's properties. So, I think we need to move that relationship so it's on the medication node instead.

So, how do we do that? We can delete the existing `ALLERGIC_TO` edge between the patient and the ingredient and then add a new one from the medication to the ingredient with the allergen information.

That makes sense. So the steps would be: first, remove the old edge, then add the new edge on the medication node.
