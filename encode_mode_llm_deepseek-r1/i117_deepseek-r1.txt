Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there's a patient who was prescribed Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection with code 205923. This medication contains oxycodone and has an allergen listed as 2013-12-21T09:55:43Z.

Looking at the graph, there's a relationship called 'HAS_INGREDIENT' between the medication (m) and the ingredient (i). But wait, the problem is that this same ingredient (oxycodone) is also listed as an allergen. That doesn't make sense because oxycodone shouldn't be an allergen; it's a opioid.

So in the graph, both [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] and another relationship must exist where the allergen is connected to the ingredient. But since oxycodone isn't an allergen, this creates inconsistency.

I think we need to remove the 'HAS_INGREDIENT' edge because that's connecting the medication to the incorrect allergen information. Alternatively, maybe there should be a separate relationship for allergens, but according to the allowed operations, I can only modify existing edges or nodes, not add new relationships directly.

So the plan is to delete the [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] relationship where it incorrectly links the ingredient to its allergen status.
