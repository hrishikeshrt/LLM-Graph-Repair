   UPD_NODE | (i) | {name: "6757", allergy: "ALLERGIC"}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the properties of the ingredient node to indicate that it is allergic. This change is necessary because the graph shows that a patient is taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, which is factually inconsistent.
