Since there are no explicit errors in the provided text, I will assume that the task is to format the output as a standardized repair template.

Here's the formatted output:

<repairs>
ADD_NODE | [ra] | {id: 1, label: "Allergy Information", type: "string"}
ADD_NODE | [rc] | {id: 2, label: "Ingredient Information", type: "string"}
</repairs>

Note that I've added the nodes for allergy information and ingredient information with their respective IDs and labels. You can adjust these according to your specific requirements.
