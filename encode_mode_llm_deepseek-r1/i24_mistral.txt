   UPD_NODE | [i] | {ingredient: 'oxycodone', allergy: '-'}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the properties of the Ingredient node (target: i) to indicate that oxycodone is an ingredient and the patient is not allergic to it. The change in allergy status is represented by removing the 'allergic_to' relationship (DEL_EDGE) from the Patient-Ingredient pair in the original graph, but since we are only allowed to suggest one operation at a time, I have suggested updating the node properties instead.
