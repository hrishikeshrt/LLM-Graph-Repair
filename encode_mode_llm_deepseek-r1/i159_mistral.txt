   UPD_NODE | [i] | {allergenic: false}
   </repairs>

   This repair operation updates the 'Ingredient' node to indicate that it is not allergenic. The reason for this correction is based on the fact that a patient cannot be allergic to an ingredient in a medication they are taking, assuming there is no error in the data or misdiagnosis.
