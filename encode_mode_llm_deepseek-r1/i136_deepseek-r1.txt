Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The description says that a medication called "verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet" has an ingredient naproxen. But wait, there's also an allergy to naproxen. That doesn't make sense because if someone is allergic to naproxen, they shouldn't be taking it. So the inconsistency here is that a medication with an ingredient someone is allergic to should not exist.

Looking at the graph query, I see that the patient (p) takes this medication (m), which has an ingredient (i). Then, the patient also has an allergy to another ingredient (i2). But since the medication's ingredient is naproxen and the patient is allergic to it, there should be no edge connecting the medication to the ingredient. That means the [rc] relationship between m and i is incorrect.

So the fix would be to remove that edge because having a medication with an ingredient you're allergic to doesn't make sense. Therefore, I'll need to delete the [rc] relationship.
