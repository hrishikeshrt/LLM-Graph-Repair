The inconsistency suggests either removing the medication or updating the allergy information.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n1. If the patient should not be taking the medication due to the allergy:\n   - Remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication.\n\n2. If the allergen information is incorrect and the patient is indeed allergic, no change is needed for the allergy itself.\n\nAssuming the medication should be removed due to the allergy:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rm] | -\n</repairs>",
