Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        
The graph consists of three nodes: a Patient, a Medication, and an Ingredient (which is actually a Medication). The Patient has a birthdate in 1911 and a deathdate in 1975. The medication Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension is taken by the Patient starting on January 8, 1961. This medication contains an Ingredient called mestranol. There seems to be a possible error with the ALLERGIC_TO relationship as both start and stop dates are empty.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
