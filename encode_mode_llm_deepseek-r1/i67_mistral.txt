   </repairs>

   This repair operation updates the `Patient` node (target: `[p]`) by removing the allergy to ingredient 6847 from its list of allergies (details: `{allergies: filter(x in p.allergies where x != 6847)}`). This is necessary because a patient cannot be both taking a medication that contains an allergen and not having an allergy to that ingredient.
