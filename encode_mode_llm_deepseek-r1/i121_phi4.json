  "content": "To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient's allergy and medication-taking timeline are accurately reflected in the graph. The patient developed an allergy to \"oxycodone\" on May 13, 2017, and should have discontinued taking \"Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection\" from that date.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n1. Ensure there is a property indicating when the patient discontinued the medication due to the allergy.\n2. If necessary, add or update properties related to the allergy start date.\n\n<repairs>\nUPD_EDGE | [rm] | {discontinued: \"2017-05-13\"}\n</repairs>\n\n<repairs>\nUPD_NODE | i | {allergy_start_date: \"2017-05-13\"}\n</repairs>",
