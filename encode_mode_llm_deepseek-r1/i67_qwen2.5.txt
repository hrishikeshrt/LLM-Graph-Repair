It seems there was a typo in the example output. Let's correct that and provide the proper format.

The patient already has an allergic reaction to epoetin alfa, so we should ensure this relationship is correctly established or update it if necessary. Given the current setup, no new relationships need to be added or deleted; instead, we can verify the existing relationship properties.

Here's the corrected output:

UPD_NODE | p | {allergicReactions: ["epoetin alfa"]}
