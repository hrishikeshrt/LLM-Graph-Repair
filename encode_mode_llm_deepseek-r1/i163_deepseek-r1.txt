Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

Looking at the code provided, there are two relationships from the patient (p) to the medication (m): one is 'TAKES_MEDICATION' and the other is 'ALLERGIC_TO'. The medication has an ingredient (i), which is Mestranol. The problem seems to be that the patient is taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, but it's also linked to Mestranol through the 'TAKES_MEDICATION' relationship.

Wait, no, actually, looking closer: the 'rm:TAKES MEDICATION' goes from p to m, and then 'rc:HAS_INGREDIENT' connects m to i. The 'ra:ALLERGIC_TO' also connects p to i. So the patient is taking a medication that has an ingredient they're allergic to.

But in reality, if someone is on a medication with an allergen, they shouldn't be connected via 'ALLERGIC_TO'. That's probably the inconsistency here. The patient can't have an allergy to the medication because they are taking it. So the 'ra:ALLERGIC_TO' relationship should be removed.

So I need to delete that edge between p and i.
