   UPD_EDGE | [rm, ra] | {allergy: "safe"}
   </repairs>

   The given graph has an inconsistency where a patient is allergic to an ingredient of the medication they are taking. To fix this, we update both relationships (`rm` and `ra`) associated with the patient and the medication, setting their allergy properties to "safe". This assumes that the patient is not actually allergic to the medication or its ingredients.
