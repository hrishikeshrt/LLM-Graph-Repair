This is inconsistent since a person cannot be allergic to a medication they are taking. To fix this, we update the stop date of the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship to match the start date (indicating the medication was taken only up to that point). We add a new non-allergen ingredient node for Epogen and connect it to the medication node with a HAS_INGREDIENT relationship. This way, we maintain the factual consistency of the graph while preserving the information about the patient's medication history.",
