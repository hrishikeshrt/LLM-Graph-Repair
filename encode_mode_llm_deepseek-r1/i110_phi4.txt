To address the inconsistency, we need to ensure that the patient's allergic reaction is correctly linked only to the medication they are actually allergic to. The current graph suggests an allergy to an ingredient in both medications, but only one medication caused an allergic reaction.

Here are the suggested repairs:

1. Identify which medication (Epogen or the other) caused the allergic reaction.
2. Remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship if it exists for the wrong medication.

Assuming the allergic reaction is not to Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, we need to remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship related to any ingredient of Epogen.

This operation assumes that the incorrect allergy link exists and needs removal. If more specific information is available about which medication caused the reaction, further refinement can be made by targeting only the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship.
