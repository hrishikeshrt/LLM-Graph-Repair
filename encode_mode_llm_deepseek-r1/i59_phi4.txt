The inconsistency described involves a patient who is allergic to an ingredient found in a medication they are taking. This situation suggests that there might be an error in either the allergy or medication data, as it could pose a health risk if not addressed.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to consider whether the allergy information is incorrect or if the medication should not contain that ingredient. Since the description does not specify which piece of information is wrong, we will assume the allergy data might be inaccurate for this repair suggestion.
