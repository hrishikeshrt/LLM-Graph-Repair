     UPD_NODE | [i] | {allergen: false}
   </repairs>

   Explanation: The inconsistency is that the patient Brekke496 has an allergy to Ingredient i, but it was also listed as an ingredient in their medication. To fix this issue, we update the property of node i (Ingredient) to indicate that it is not an allergen. This change ensures that the graph remains factually accurate.
