However, the text description suggests that the allergy information might be incorrect. To fix this inconsistency, we update the properties of the `Patient` node (target: [p]) by removing the allergy information (details: {allergy_info: \"-\"}). This repair operation assumes that the patient is not actually allergic to any ingredient in their medication.",
