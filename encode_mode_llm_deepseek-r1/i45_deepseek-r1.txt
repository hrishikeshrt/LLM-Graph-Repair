Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The query matches a patient taking verapamil until August 30, 1986. Verapamil was an ingredient in the medication, but there's an allergen issue with that medication. So, the problem is that verapamil is both an ingredient and an allergen for the same medication. That seems contradictory because if it's an allergen, it shouldn't be listed as an ingredient.

Looking at the graph structure: Patient (p) takes medication (m), which has an ingredient (i). There's also a relationship [ra:ALLERGIC_TO] from p to i. So, verapamil is both an ingredient and an allergen for the patient.

The inconsistency here is that verapamil can't be both at the same time. Therefore, I need to fix this by removing either the ingredient or the allergen relationship.

I have two options: remove the [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] edge so that verapamil isn't listed as an ingredient anymore, leaving only the allergen relationship. Alternatively, I could remove the [ra:ALLERGIC_TO] relationship so that verapamil is listed as an ingredient but without the allergen note.

I think removing the ingredient makes more sense because the main issue is the allergen. So, by deleting the edge where verapamil is an ingredient, we can keep it as an allergen without contradiction.

So, I'll perform a DEL_EDGE operation on [rc] to remove that relationship.
