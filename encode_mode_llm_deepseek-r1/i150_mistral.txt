   UPD_NODE | [i] | {allergen: 'Insulin'}
   </repairs>

   This repair updates the Ingredient node's allergen property to 'Insulin', as Insulin is not typically an allergen in Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension. The assumption here is that the inconsistency lies in the incorrect association of a patient with an allergy to the ingredient of their medication, rather than a problem with the medication or its ingredient itself.
