Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The graph has a patient who took verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet. The medication has an ingredient called verapamil with ID e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93. But there's also an edge from the patient to this verapamil ingredient via [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]. Wait, that doesn't make sense because verapamil is the medication itself, not an ingredient in it. So the patient has verapamil as a medication, which contains other ingredients, but verapamil shouldn't be listed under HAS_INGREDIENT.

So the problem here is that the [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] relationship is incorrectly pointing to verapamil when it should point to another ingredient within the medication. That's why there's an inconsistency because the patient shouldn't have verapamil as an ingredient; they take a medication that contains other ingredients, one of which is verapamil.

To fix this, I need to adjust the relationship so that instead of linking to verapamil, it links to another node representing its active ingredient. So first, I should add a new node for the active ingredient. Let's call it something like "ActiveIngredient" with an ID and properties indicating it's part of the medication.

Next, I need to update the [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] relationship from verapamil to this new ActiveIngredient node. That way, the patient is correctly linked to their medication's active ingredient.

So in terms of operations, first add the new node with its properties and then modify the edge to point to this new node instead of verapamil.
