The inconsistency identified in this scenario is that the patient has an allergenic relationship with mestranol, but Humulin 70/30 does not contain mestranol as an ingredient. Therefore, the allergenic relationship to mestranol is incorrect based on the medication's ingredients.

To correct this inconsistency, we should remove the incorrect allergy relationship between the patient and mestranol.
