Explanation: The inconsistency arises because a patient named Sanford861 is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the problematic medication. This prevents the system from suggesting or allowing such a treatment plan. No new nodes or edges are added since the goal is to prevent the use of the allergenic medication, not to substitute it with another.
