    </repairs>

This repair suggests that the edge connecting Sanford861 and 1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection should be removed, as it is inconsistent with the fact that the person is taking a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to. Additionally, the allergenic status of the oxycodone ingredient is updated to "non-allergen" to resolve the inconsistency.
