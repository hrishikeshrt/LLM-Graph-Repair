This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient "Kendal125" and the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which contains an ingredient "mestranol" that the patient is allergic to. This action resolves the inconsistency by ensuring the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen.
