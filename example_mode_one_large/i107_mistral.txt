This repair suggests removing the existing allergy relationship and updating the medicine node to remove the offending medication description, while also adding a new ingredient node for oxycodone. The medicine node is then updated with this new ingredient. This way, the patient is no longer allergic to the medicine they are taking, as it will now be represented as not containing the allergen.
