Explanation:
- The inconsistency arises because a patient, Sanford861, is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the medication (`TAKES_MEDICATION`), ensuring the patient does not take a medicine containing an allergen. This operation directly addresses the factual inconsistency without altering other parts of the graph unnecessarily.
