This repair suggests to remove the existing allergy relationship between Logan497 and oxycodone, remove the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between the medicine and oxycodone, update the ingredient node without an id property, add a new medication node with the correct description but without an id property, remove the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship between Logan497 and the problematic medicine, and finally add a new TAKES_MEDICATION relationship between Logan497 and the corrected medicine.
