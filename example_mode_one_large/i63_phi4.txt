This repair operation removes the existing relationship between the patient "Sanford861" and the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" to address the inconsistency where the medication contains an ingredient ("ferrous sulfate") that the patient is allergic to. This ensures that Sanford861 does not take a medication containing an allergen.
