Explanation:
- The inconsistency is that a patient "Walker122" takes medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, we remove the relationship `(p)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m)` where `p` is the patient and `m` is the medication containing the allergen. This prevents the patient from being treated with a medicine that contains an ingredient they're allergic to.
