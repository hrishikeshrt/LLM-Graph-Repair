Explanation: The inconsistency lies in the fact that a patient is taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To fix this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the allergenic ingredient (oxycodone). Then, we update the patient node without modifying any properties since no information was provided. Next, we add a new non-allergenic ingredient for the medication. Lastly, we create a new relationship between the medication and the newly created non-allergenic ingredient.
