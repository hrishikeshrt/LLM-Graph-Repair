This repair operation removes the relationship between the patient "Moises22" and the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which contains an ingredient ("mestranol") that Moises22 is allergic to. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that Moises22 does not take a medication containing an allergen.
