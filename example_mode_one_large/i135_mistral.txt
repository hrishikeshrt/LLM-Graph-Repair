This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between Patient and Ingredient, updating the offending ingredient with a new unique id, adding a new allergy for the patient to the updated ingredient, and finally linking the updated ingredient to the medication. This way, the inconsistency is resolved while preserving as much of the original data as possible.
