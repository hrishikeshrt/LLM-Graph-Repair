Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and the allergenic Ingredient to make the graph consistent.
- Update the properties of the allergenic Ingredient (oxycodone) with a new unique id to avoid future inconsistencies.
- Add a new Medicine node with the correct description and a new unique id.
- Establish a relationship between the Patient and the new Medicine.
- Update the properties of the ALLERGIC_TO relationships involving the allergenic Ingredient (oxycodone) with new unique ids for both the Patient and Ingredient to avoid future inconsistencies.
- Add a new HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between the new Medicine node and a new Ingredient node, which should not be the allergenic one. The id of this new Ingredient node is not specified in the given information.
