The first operation removes the existing relationship between the patient and the ingredient, as it is inconsistent. The second operation does not modify the node for oxycodone since there seems to be no issue with its current properties. The third operation creates a new relationship indicating that the patient is not allergic to oxycodone. This relationship should not exist in the graph if the patient is indeed not allergic to the ingredient.
