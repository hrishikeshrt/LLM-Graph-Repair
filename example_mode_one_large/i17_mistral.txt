This repair suggests removing the relationship between the medicine and oxycodone, updating the patient's record without any changes, adding a new allergy for the patient to another safe ingredient, creating a new medicine with a different description that does not contain oxycodone as an ingredient, and establishing a relationship between the new medicine and the safe ingredient.
