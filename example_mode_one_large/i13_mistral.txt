This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between `Logan497` and `oxycodone`, as it is inconsistent with the described rule. Then, it adds a new ingredient `epogen` to the medicine `1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection`, and establishes that `Logan497` is allergic to this new ingredient.
