This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between the medicine and its ingredient that the patient is allergic to, and updating the relationship between the patient and the medicine if the patient is not allergic to that medicine's ingredients. The details section contains no changes as it assumes the original properties remain unchanged unless explicitly specified otherwise.
