This repair operation suggests that the allergy of the patient should be updated to include ferrous sulfate, and the medication taken by the patient should not have ferrous sulfate as an ingredient. It also removes the existing relationship between the patient and the medication, and between the medication and the ingredient, since they are no longer consistent with the allergy information. Finally, it adds a new relationship between the patient and the newly added ingredient to reflect the updated allergy information.
