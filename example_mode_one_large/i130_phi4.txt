This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient "Reyna401" and the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet," which contains an ingredient ("metformin") that the patient is allergic to. This ensures compliance with the rule that a person should not be treated with a medicine containing an allergen they are sensitive to.
