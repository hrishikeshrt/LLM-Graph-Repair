Explanation:
1. Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medicine that is causing the inconsistency (rm).
2. Mark the allergenic property of oxycodone as true, since it's an allergen for this patient.
3. Add a new ingredient to the medicine with a unique id and non-allergenic property. This new ingredient will replace the one causing the inconsistency (oxycodone).
4. Update the newly created ingredient with a unique id.
5. Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Ingredient that is causing the inconsistency (ra).
6. Add a new relationship between the patient and the medicine, using 'CAN_TAKE_MEDICATION' instead of 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. This is to reflect that the patient can take the modified version of the medicine without the allergenic ingredient.
