Okay, so I'm trying to fix this inconsistency where a patient is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they're allergic to. Let me break it down.

First, looking at the graph structure: the patient (p) takes medication (m), which has an ingredient (i). The patient is also allergic to that same ingredient. This setup isn't right because if you take a medication with an allergen you're allergic to, it's dangerous.

I need to figure out how to represent this correctly. Maybe we should prevent the connection between taking the medication and being allergic to its ingredients. So perhaps removing the relationship from taking the medication to having that ingredient would help. That way, if someone is allergic, they can't take any medication with that allergen.

So I'll delete the `rm` relationship because it's connecting the patient to the medication via an ingredient they shouldn't be exposed to.
