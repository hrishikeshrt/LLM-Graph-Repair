This is because Earle679 should not be taking a medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, so we need to separate them in the graph.\n- Delete the edge `ra` connecting `p` and `i`. This is because once Earle679 stops taking the allergenic medication, they no longer have an allergy to it.\n- Create a new node for the medicine that Earle679 was taking (HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet). We give it a unique ID `NEW_MEDICINE_ID`.\n- Update the node `m1` with the correct description of the medicine.\n- Add an edge connecting `p` and `m1`, representing that Earle679 is taking the new, non-allergenic version of the medicine.",
