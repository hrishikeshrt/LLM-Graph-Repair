This repair suggests removing the edge between the medicine and its ingredient that causes an allergy for the patient, updating the patient node without any changes, adding a new medicine node with a unique id, and creating a new TAKES_MEDICATION relationship between the patient and the new medicine node. This way, the patient is no longer taking the specific medicine causing the inconsistency.
