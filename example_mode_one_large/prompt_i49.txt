---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        A person should not be treated with a medicine that contains an ingredient

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | (rm) | -
ADD_NODE | (m1:Medicine) | description="medication-name"
ADD_EDGE | (p)-[:TAKES_MEDICATION]-> (m1) | -
</repairs>
