To fix this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the medication (rm), mark the allergenic property of the ingredient as true, add a new relationship between the patient and the ingredient (allergic_to), remove the relationship between the medication and the ingredient (rc), update the medication node to exclude ferrous sulfate from its ingredients, and finally re-establish the relationship between the patient and the updated medication.",
