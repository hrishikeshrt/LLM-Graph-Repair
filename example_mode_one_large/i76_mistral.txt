Explanation:
- Remove the allergy relationship between Walker122 and epoetin alfa (DEL_EDGE) as it is incorrect.
- Update the description property of the medicine that Walker122 takes to "-" since it is not appropriate for this example (UPD_NODE).
- Add a new medicine node with the correct description (ADD_NODE).
- Remove the ingredient relationship between the incorrect medicine and epoetin alfa (DEL_EDGE) as it is incorrect.
- Add a new takes_medication relationship between Walker122 and the corrected medicine (ADD_EDGE).
