Explanation: To resolve the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication. The operation `DEL_EDGE` effectively removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient and the problematic medication. This ensures compliance with the rule that patients should not be treated with medications containing ingredients they are allergic to. No additional nodes or relationships need to be added, as the focus is solely on removing the inappropriate treatment connection.
