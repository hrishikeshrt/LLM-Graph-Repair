Explanation:
- The inconsistency lies in the fact that a person (Sanford861) takes a medicine (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) which contains an ingredient (oxycodone) that he is allergic to. To fix this, we first remove the relationship between the Medicine and its Ingredient (oxycodone).
- Then, we update the Person node with a new unique id for the medicine it actually takes (new_medicine_id), as the current one seems to be incorrect due to the inconsistency.
- After that, we add a new Medicine node with the correct description and the new unique id.
- Finally, we add a new relationship between the Person and the newly created Medicine node.
