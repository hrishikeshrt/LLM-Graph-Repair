Explanation: The inconsistency arises because a patient, Logan497, is taking medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" which contains an ingredient "mestranol", to which they are allergic. To resolve this, the relationship indicating that Logan497 takes this specific medication should be removed, as it is unsafe for them due to their allergy.
