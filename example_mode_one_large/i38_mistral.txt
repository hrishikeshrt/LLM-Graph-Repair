Here, I suggest the removal of the inconsistent relationship between Astrid395 and naproxen as an allergen. Then, I update the property of the ingredient node 'naproxen' to remove the allergenic_to property (since it is not appropriate for an allergen to be associated with itself). Finally, I add a new relationship between Astrid395 and naproxen indicating that she is allergic to it. This way, the graph accurately represents that Astrid395 should not take any medication containing naproxen due to her allergy.
