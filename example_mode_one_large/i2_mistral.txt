Explanation:
- Update the edge `rc` to remove the relationship between medicine and ingredient, as the medicine no longer contains the allergenic ingredient.
- Delete the existing edge `ra` between patient and ingredient, since the patient is no longer allergic to the incorrect ingredient.
- Change the ID of the ingredient node to a unique value (for example, "-").
- Add a new ingredient node with the correct ID "exemestane".
- Add an edge `HAS_INGREDIENT` between the updated medicine node and the new ingredient node.
- Add an edge `ALLERGIC_TO` between the patient and the new ingredient node to reflect the allergy correctly.
