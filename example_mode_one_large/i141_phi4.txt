This repair operation removes the relationship between the patient `Marcellus830` and the medication `24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet`, which contains an ingredient (`ferrous sulfate`) to which Marcellus is allergic. This ensures that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen, resolving the inconsistency.
