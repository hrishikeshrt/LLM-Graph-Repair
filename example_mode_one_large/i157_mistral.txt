    </repairs>

This repair suggests removing the inconsistent relationship between `Patient` and `Medication`, marking the ingredient `ferrous sulfate` as allergic to `Isiah14`, and leaving the other properties unchanged. This way, the graph will no longer contain an inconsistency where a person takes a medicine that contains an allergen.
