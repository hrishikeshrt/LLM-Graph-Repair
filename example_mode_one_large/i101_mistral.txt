This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between the patient and the medicine, as they cannot take it due to an allergy. Then, it updates the ingredient node to not have any allergenic substance. Finally, it adds a new relationship between the medicine and the updated ingredient node. This way, the graph remains consistent with the fact that a person should not take a medicine containing an allergen if they are allergic to it.
