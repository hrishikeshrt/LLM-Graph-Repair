Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medication (rm) as the patient is allergic to an ingredient in the medication.
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Ingredient (ra) as it contradicts the fact that the patient takes the medication.
- Update the Patient node with a new property "allergies" to reflect that the patient is allergic to warfarin.
- Create a new Medication node with updated properties to reflect that the medication does not contain warfarin (ingredients=-warfarin).
- Add a new relationship between the updated Patient and the new Medication node as the patient now takes a modified version of the medication without warfarin.
