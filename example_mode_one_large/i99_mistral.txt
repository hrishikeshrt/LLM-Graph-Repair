    DEL_EDGE | (rc) | WHERE i.id = "mestranol"
    UPD_NODE | (p) | -

Explanation:
- Remove the existing edge between Medicine and Ingredient as it contains an ingredient that the patient is allergic to (DEL_EDGE | (rc)).
- Update the Patient node with a new allergy (UPD_NODE | (p)). The new allergy should be the same ingredient but with a different id, as we cannot change the id of an existing node. Let's call it "new_ingredient_id".
- Add a new Ingredient node for the allergy found in the medicine (ADD_NODE | (i1:Ingredient)). The id of this new ingredient should be "new_ingredient_id". This will allow us to create a new relationship between the Patient and the new Ingredient node.
- Create a new relationship between the Patient and the newly created Ingredient node (ADD_EDGE | (p)-[:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i1)).
