Note: The above suggestions assume that the graph already has nodes for Walker122, 1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, epoetin alfa, and epogen alfa. If not, you may need to add those nodes as well. Also, the `allergies` property is assumed to be a JSON array of allergens that the patient has. The suggested repair updates the patient's allergy for epoetin alfa to false (indicating that the patient is no longer allergic to it). Similarly, the ingredient node's id is updated to indicate that it does not contain epoetin alfa anymore. Finally, a new relationship between the medicine and the ingredient nodes is added, indicating that the medicine does not contain the allergen (epoetin alfa) anymore.
