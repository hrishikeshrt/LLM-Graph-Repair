To resolve this, we need to remove the relationship where the patient takes the problematic medication.\n- `DEL_EDGE` operation is used to delete the edge `(rm:TAKES_MEDICATION)` between the patient node and the medication node containing the allergen. This prevents the patient from being treated with a medicine they are allergic to.",
