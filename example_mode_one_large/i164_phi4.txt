This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient "Kendal125" and the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which contains an ingredient "mestranol" to which the patient is allergic. This prevents the inconsistency of treating a person with a medicine they are allergic to.
