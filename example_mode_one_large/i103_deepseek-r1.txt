Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, there's a patient who is taking a medication that has an ingredient which they're allergic to. That doesn't seem safe, so we need to adjust the graph to reflect this correctly.

Looking at the query, it matches a patient (p) taking a medication (m), which has an ingredient (i). The patient is also allergic to that same ingredient. This setup creates a situation where the medication shouldn't be prescribed because of the allergy.

I think the main issue here is having both the medication and its ingredient in the graph when they're connected through the patient's allergy. Maybe we should remove the connection between the medication and its ingredient since it's not necessary for determining safety.

So, perhaps I can delete the relationship that links the medication to its ingredient. That way, there's no confusion about whether the patient is allergic to an ingredient in their medication.
