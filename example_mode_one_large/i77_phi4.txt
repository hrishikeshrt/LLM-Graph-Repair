**Explanation:**
- The inconsistency is that a patient, Walker122, takes medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, we remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication. This ensures compliance with the rule that patients should not be treated with medications containing allergens they are sensitive to.
