Explanation: The inconsistency is that Teddy976 takes a medicine (m) containing an ingredient (i) he's allergic to. To fix this, we need to remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between Teddy and metformin, update the description of the current medication (m) to be blank (since it is not suitable for Teddy), add a new medicine for Teddy that doesn't contain metformin. The new medicine will have the same description as the original one.
