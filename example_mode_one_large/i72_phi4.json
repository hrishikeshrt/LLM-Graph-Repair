To resolve this, we remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the problematic medication (`TAKES_MEDICATION`). This ensures the patient is no longer treated with a medicine containing an allergen they are sensitive to. No additional nodes or edges need to be added in this context as the solution focuses on preventing the specific inconsistency identified.",
