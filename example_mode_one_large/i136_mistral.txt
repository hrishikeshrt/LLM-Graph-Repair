Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medicine as the person should not be taking this medicine.
- Update the Ingredient node to mark it as allergenic since it is causing an allergic reaction.
- Add a new relationship between the Medicine and the updated Ingredient node.
- Update the Patient node to include the newly marked allergenic ingredient in the `allergenicTo` list.
- Finally, add a new relationship between the Patient and the updated Ingredient node to reflect the allergic relationship.
