This repair suggests removing the relationship between Samatha845 and Olmesartan as an ingredient, as it is inconsistent with her allergy. It also adds a new medicine (m1) that does not contain Olmesartan, which Samatha845 can take instead. The new medicine will have the same description as the original one but without the allergen.
