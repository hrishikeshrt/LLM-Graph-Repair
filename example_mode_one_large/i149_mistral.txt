Explanation: The inconsistency arises from the patient taking a medicine that contains an allergenic ingredient. To resolve this, we remove the relationship between the medication and the allergenic ingredient (del_edge on rc). Then, we update the patient node to indicate they are not allergic to the problematic ingredient (upd_node on p). We add a new non-allergenic ingredient for the patient (add_edge on ra and create a new node i1). Next, we create a new medicine m1 that does not contain the allergenic ingredient (add_edge on rc between m1 and i1). Finally, we assign a different medication to the patient (add_edge on rm1 and create a new node m1 for the new medicine).
