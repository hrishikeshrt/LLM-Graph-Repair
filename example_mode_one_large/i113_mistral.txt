Explanation: The inconsistency is that a person takes a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To fix this, we remove the existing relationship between the patient and the original ingredient (`rm` and `ra` edges), add a new ingredient for the medicine with a different id (oxygen instead of oxycodone) and update the patient's allergy to the new ingredient.
