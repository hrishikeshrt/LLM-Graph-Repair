This repair operation removes the relationship between the patient "Boyd728" and the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which contains an ingredient that the patient is allergic to. This ensures compliance with the rule that a person should not be treated with a medicine containing an allergen they are sensitive to.
