To fix this, we first remove the relationship between the Medicine and its Ingredient (oxycodone).\n- Then, we update the Person node with a new unique id for the medicine it actually takes (new_medicine_id), as the current one seems to be incorrect due to the inconsistency.\n- After that, we add a new Medicine node with the correct description and the new unique id.\n- Finally, we add a new relationship between the Person and the newly created Medicine node.",
