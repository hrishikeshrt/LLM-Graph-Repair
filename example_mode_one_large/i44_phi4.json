To resolve this, we need to remove the relationship where Cassandra224 takes Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet, as it contains chlorthalidone, which she is allergic to. This is accomplished by deleting the `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge `(rm)`. No additional nodes or edges are added because the goal is to prevent the patient from taking a medication that could harm her due to an allergy.",
