Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we remove the existing relationship between Patient and Oxycodone allergy. Then, we update the patient's record to reflect a different allergen (non-oxycodone-allergen). After that, we delete the relationship between the patient and the medicine containing oxycodone. Finally, we add an alternative medicine for the patient that does not contain oxycodone as an ingredient.
