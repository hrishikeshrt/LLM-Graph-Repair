Explanation: The inconsistency arises because a patient, Isiah14, is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the medication (`TAKES_MEDICATION`). This ensures that the patient no longer takes the problematic medication. No additional nodes or edges need to be added or modified in this context.
