This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between Medicine and Ingredient, updating the Patient node to reflect the new allergy, and adding a new AllergicTo relationship for the patient and the ingredient. The new medicine should be chosen carefully to avoid the allergen. The `some_medicine_id` placeholder represents the unique identifier of the medicine that Logan497 is currently taking but which contains mestranol. This operation assumes that a unique identifier exists for each Medicine node in the graph.
