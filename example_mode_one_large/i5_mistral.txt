Explanation:
- Update the edge `rc` connecting `i` and `m` to remove Earle679 as the source. This is because Earle679 should not be taking a medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, so we need to separate them in the graph.
- Delete the edge `ra` connecting `p` and `i`. This is because once Earle679 stops taking the allergenic medication, they no longer have an allergy to it.
- Create a new node for the medicine that Earle679 was taking (HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet). We give it a unique ID `NEW_MEDICINE_ID`.
- Update the node `m1` with the correct description of the medicine.
- Add an edge connecting `p` and `m1`, representing that Earle679 is taking the new, non-allergenic version of the medicine.
