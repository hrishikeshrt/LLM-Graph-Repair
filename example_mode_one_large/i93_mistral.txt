This repair suggests removing the inconsistent relationship, updating the ingredient node to remove its allergenic property, and adding a new allergy relationship for the patient with the same ingredient. This repair assumes that the allergenic_substance property of the ingredient is set to true by default if not specified, and sets it to false when the ingredient is no longer considered an allergen for the specific patient.
