This repair suggests removing the existing `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between Rosio404 and verapamil, and updating the allergenic status of the ingredient verapamil to non-allergen. This change allows for consistency with the fact that a person should not be allergic to an ingredient they are taking as medication. However, since it is unclear whether the inconsistency lies in the patient's reported allergy or the ingredient's status, I have chosen the least disruptive repair by updating the allergenic status of the ingredient.
