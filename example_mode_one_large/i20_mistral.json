It also updates the medication's description to an empty string, as it should not be associated with any specific medication in this case. Finally, a new relationship is added for the updated medicine (m) to take a new ingredient (i), but without specifying any details such as amount or id, as that information should be provided based on the appropriate medication for the patient.",
