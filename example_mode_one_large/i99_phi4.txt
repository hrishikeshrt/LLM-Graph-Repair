This repair operation removes the relationship between the patient "Earle679" and the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which contains an ingredient "mestranol" to which the patient is allergic. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen.
