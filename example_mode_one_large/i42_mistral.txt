Explanation:
- The first operation removes the existing allergy relationship between Cassandra224 and chlorthalidone since a person should not be allergic to an ingredient they are not taking.
- The second operation updates the description of the medicine that was incorrectly assigned to Cassandra224.
- The third operation adds a new TAKES_MEDICATION relationship for Cassandra224 with the correct medicine (Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet).
