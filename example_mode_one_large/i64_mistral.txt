Explanation:
- Remove the relationship between Patient and Medicine as the current one is inconsistent.
- Update the Ingredient node 'ferrous sulfate' to remove it from the Medicine node it is currently associated with (as it is no longer an ingredient of the medicine).
- Create a new Medicine node with the correct description and no associated ingredients.
- Add a new relationship between the Patient and the newly created Medicine, indicating that the patient does not have an allergy to this medicine. This allows for the possibility of finding another medicine without the allergenic ingredient.
