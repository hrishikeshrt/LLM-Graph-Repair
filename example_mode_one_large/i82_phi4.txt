Explanation: The inconsistency arises because a patient named "Walker122" is taking medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic. To resolve this, we remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication. This prevents the graph from reflecting the incorrect treatment scenario. No additional nodes or relationships need to be added or modified in this context.
