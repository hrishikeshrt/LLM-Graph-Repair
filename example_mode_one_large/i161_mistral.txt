This repair suggests updating the `allergic_to` property of the ingredient node to false, removing the existing edge between the patient and the medicine that contains the allergen, adding a new edge between the medicine and the allergen-free ingredient. The assumption is that there exists an alternative ingredient for the medication which does not cause an allergic reaction to the patient.
