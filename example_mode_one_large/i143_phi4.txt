This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient "Samatha845" and the medication "Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG / Olmesartan medoxomil 20 MG Oral Tablet [Tribenzor]" because it contains an ingredient ("olmesartan") to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that Samatha845 does not take a medication containing an allergen she is allergic to, resolving the inconsistency.
