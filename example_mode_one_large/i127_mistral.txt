In this case, we need to remove the incorrect relationship between the patient and the medicine that contains an allergen. We also need to update the patient's first name to match the provided value. Since the medicine is incorrectly associated with oxycodone as an ingredient, we must remove that relationship and create a new medicine node without the allergen as an ingredient. We then associate the corrected medicine with the patient.
