To resolve this, we remove the relationship indicating that Moises22 takes Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, as it contains mestranol, an allergen for Moises22. This ensures compliance with the requirement that patients should not be treated with medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.",
