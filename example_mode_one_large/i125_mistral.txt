This repair suggests removing the existing relationships between the patient, medicine and ingredient (oxycodone), updating the medicine node with a new unique identifier and replacing the oxycodone ingredient with a non-allergenic one. The exact properties for the new medicine and non-allergenic ingredient are not specified in the given information, so they will have to be defined according to the application's requirements.
