Explanation: To resolve the inconsistency, we first remove the existing relationship between the patient and oxycodone ingredient (DEL_EDGE on rc). Then, update the patient node with a new allergy to another ingredient (UPD_NODE on p and ADD_EDGE on ra). Next, we remove the incorrect medication-ingredient relationship for the problematic medicine (DEL_EDGE on rm). Finally, add a new alternative medicine that the patient is taking (ADD_EDGE on rm1) without any oxycodone ingredient.
