    Here, I suggest removing the existing relationship between the Medicine and Ingredient that causes the allergy. Then, I update the Patient's record without any changes since it is not causing the inconsistency directly. Afterward, I add an alternative medicine (m1) that does not contain the allergenic ingredient. The new medicine has a different description ("alternative-medicine-name"). Finally, I add a new relationship between the alternative medicine and a safe ingredient (i1).
