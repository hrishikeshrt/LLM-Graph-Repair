To resolve this issue, we need to remove the relationship indicating that Rosio404 takes verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet, as it contains verapamil, an allergen for them.\n\nThe repair operation suggested is `DEL_EDGE`, targeting the relationship `(rm)` between the patient and the medication. This ensures Rosio404 no longer has a record of taking this specific medication in the graph database.",
