Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between `Patient` and `Medication` (rm) as the patient should not be taking this medicine.
- Update the property of the `Ingredient` node to mark it as allergenic since it is causing an allergic reaction.
- Add a new relationship between the updated `Medication` node and the modified `Ingredient` node to reflect that the medicine contains oxycodone, which is now marked as allergenic.
- Remove the existing relationship between `Patient` and `Ingredient` (ra) since the patient should not be allergic to an ingredient in a medicine they are not taking.
