This repair suggests removing the relationship between the ingredient and the medicine, updating the patient's information to reflect that they are not currently taking the problematic medication, and adding a new relationship between the patient and an alternative medication. The specific properties for the alternative medication are not provided in the description, so I have left them as "-". This repair assumes that there exists an `ALTERNATIVE_MEDICATION` relationship type in the graph schema.
