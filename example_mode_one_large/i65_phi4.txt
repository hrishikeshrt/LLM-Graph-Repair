This repair operation removes the existing relationship between the patient "Walker122" and the medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, thus resolving the inconsistency. The patient should not take a medication that includes an allergen. By deleting this edge, we ensure compliance with the requirement that patients do not receive medications containing substances they're allergic to.
