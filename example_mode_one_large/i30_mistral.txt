This repair suggests updating the existing relationship between the Ingredient node and the Patient node to remove the allergy, replacing the ingredient in question with a different id, adding a new allergy relationship for the same patient-ingredient pair, and leaving all other properties unchanged. This repair maintains factual accuracy by removing the inconsistency while preserving as much of the original graph as possible.
