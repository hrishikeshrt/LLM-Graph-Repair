This repair suggests that the existing relationship between the patient and the ingredient should be removed, as it is incorrect. Then, the allergy property of the ingredient is updated to "false", indicating that the patient is no longer allergic to it. Finally, a new relationship is added between the patient and the ingredient (verapamil hydrochloride), reflecting the correct state that the patient is now allergic to this ingredient.
