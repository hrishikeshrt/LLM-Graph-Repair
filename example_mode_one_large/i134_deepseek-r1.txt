Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The scenario is about a patient taking a medication that has an ingredient which they're allergic to. Specifically, the patient (Boyd728) is taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, which contains mestranol. The system currently shows that the patient is allergic to mestranol through another relationship.

First, I'll look at the existing graph structure. There's a path: Patient -> Takes medication -> Medication ingredient -> Allergic to ingredient.

The problem here is that the system incorrectly connects the patient to the ingredient, making it seem like they're allergic when they shouldn't be because the medication contains the allergen. So, we need to remove this incorrect relationship.

I think the correct approach is to delete the edge that shows the patient's allergy to the ingredient. That way, the graph won't suggest avoiding the medication based on an irrelevant allergic reaction.

So, I'll use the DEL_EDGE operation, targeting the 'rc' relationship between the patient and the ingredient.
