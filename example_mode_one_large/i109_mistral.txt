This repair suggests removing the relationship between the medicine and oxycodone, updating the patient's record to not list an allergy to oxycodone, adding a new safe ingredient that the patient is allergic to (with a different id), creating a new medication without oxycodone as an ingredient, and updating the description of this new medicine.
