This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient `Sanford861` and the medication `Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet`, which contains an ingredient (`clopidogrel`) that the patient is allergic to. This ensures compliance with the rule that a person should not be treated with a medicine containing an allergen they are sensitive to.
