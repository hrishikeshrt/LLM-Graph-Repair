Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship between Walker122 and epoetin alfa (rc edge), update Walker122's allergies by adding a new allergy to another ingredient with an id of epoetin beta (ra edge), and finally, create a new medicine without the problematic ingredient (m1 node) that Walker122 can take instead.
