This repair suggests removing the existing relationships between `Weldon459` and both `Medication` (rm) and `Ingredient` (ra), updating the `allergy` property of `Weldon459` to reflect that he is no longer allergic to naproxen. Then, it adds a new relationship between `Weldon459` and the same medication (m), but this time with the updated property `allergy="naproxen:true"` to indicate that he takes a medicine containing naproxen while being allergic to it.
