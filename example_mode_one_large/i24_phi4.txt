Explanation:
- The inconsistency arises because a patient, Logan497, is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, we should remove the relationship indicating that Logan497 takes the problematic medication. This ensures compliance with the rule that patients should not be treated with medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.
