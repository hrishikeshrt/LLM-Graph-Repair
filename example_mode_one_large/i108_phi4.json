To resolve this, the relationship between the patient and the medication should be removed, as it would not be safe for them to take it. This is achieved by deleting the `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge `(rm)`. No new nodes or edges need to be added in this scenario since we're addressing a safety concern by removing an inappropriate connection.",
