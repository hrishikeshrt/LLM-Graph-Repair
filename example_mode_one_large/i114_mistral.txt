    </repairs>

Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we first remove the relationship between the patient and the medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to (`DEL_EDGE | (rm) | -`). Then, we update the property of the allergenic_to for the oxycodone ingredient to be false, assuming it is not actually an allergen for this patient (`UPD_NODE | (i:Ingredient{id: 'oxycodone'}) | allergenic_to=(false)`). This change allows the patient to take the medicine again in the future if necessary.
