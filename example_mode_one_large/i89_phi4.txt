This repair operation removes the relationship where the patient "Walker122" is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, thus resolving the inconsistency. The specific edge `(p)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m)` is deleted, ensuring that the patient does not continue to take this medication.
