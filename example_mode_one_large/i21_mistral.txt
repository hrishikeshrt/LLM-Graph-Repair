This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between the patient and the medicine that contains oxycodone, updating the patient's allergy to oxygen instead of oxycodone, and adding a new medicine for the patient that is not allergic to. The specific details such as the name of the new medicine are left unspecified in this example output.
