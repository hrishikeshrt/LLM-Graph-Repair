Here, we are assuming that there exists an alternative ingredient for the medicine that Logan497 is currently taking. The repairs suggest removing the relationship between the original medicine and oxycodone, updating Logan's allergy to this alternative ingredient, adding a new medicine without oxycodone, creating a relationship between the new medicine and the alternative ingredient, and finally, updating the description of the new medicine and establishing a relationship between Logan and the new medicine.
