Explanation: The inconsistency arises because a patient, Cassandra224, is taking medication that contains an ingredient she is allergic to. To resolve this, we remove the relationship where Cassandra224 takes Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet, which contains chlorthalidone, an allergen for her. This ensures no treatment includes an allergenic ingredient.
