Explanation:
- The inconsistency arises because a patient, Altha90, is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. 
- To resolve this, we remove the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient and the medication containing the allergen. This ensures the patient does not take medicine with ingredients they're allergic to.
