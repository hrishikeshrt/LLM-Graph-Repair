To resolve the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to ensure that the patient does not continue taking this specific medication. Here's how we can address it:

1. Remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this particular medication.

This operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient "Teddy976" and the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet," which contains an ingredient "metformin" that they are allergic to. This ensures compliance with the requirement that a person should not be treated with medicine containing an allergen.

If there is an alternative medication available for the patient, additional operations might include adding a new node and edge for this alternative medication, but such details are not provided in the current context.
