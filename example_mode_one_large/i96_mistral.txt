This repair suggests removing the inconsistent relationship between Earle679 and mestranol, updating the ingredient node to exclude Earle679 from its allergic_to relationships, adding a new relationship between the medicine and the ingredient, removing the allergy relationship, and finally updating the patient node to exclude mestranol from its allergic_to list.
