Explanation: The inconsistency arises because a patient named Sanford861 is taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic. To resolve this, we should remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication (`TAKES_MEDICATION`), ensuring compliance with medical guidelines. No new nodes or edges need to be added in this scenario.
