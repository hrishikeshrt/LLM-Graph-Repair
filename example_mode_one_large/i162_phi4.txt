Explanation:
- The inconsistency is that a patient named Isiah14 is taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, we remove the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient and the medication. This prevents the patient from being treated with the medicine containing the allergen. No additional nodes or edges need to be added in this scenario.
