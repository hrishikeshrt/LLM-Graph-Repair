Explanation: The inconsistency arises because a patient, Logan497, is taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic. To resolve this, we remove the relationship indicating that Logan497 takes the medication containing oxycodone. This prevents the patient from being treated with the allergenic medication. No new nodes or edges are added; only the problematic edge is deleted.
