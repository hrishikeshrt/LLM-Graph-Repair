This repair suggests removing the allergy relationship between Earle679 and exemestane, as it is causing the inconsistency. It also leaves the medication node untouched to preserve its original description for future reference or correction. The assumption here is that there might be other medications that Earle679 is not allergic to, which can be connected through the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship.
