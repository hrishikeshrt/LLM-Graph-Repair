This repair suggests removing the existing relationships between Patient, Medication and Ingredient nodes due to the inconsistency. Then it updates the patient's allergy property to "not allergic to ferrous sulfate". A new Medicine node is added with the given description and a unique id (Glucophage), and an edge connecting the Medicine node to the Ingredient node (ferrous sulfate) is created.
