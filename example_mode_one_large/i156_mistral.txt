Explanation: The inconsistency is that a person (Isiah14) takes a medicine (24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet) which contains an ingredient (ferrous sulfate) he's allergic to. To fix this, we remove the allergy relationship between Isiah14 and ferrous sulfate, update the description of the medicine so it doesn't contain the problematic ingredient, and add a new TAKES_MEDICATION relationship with the updated medicine details.
