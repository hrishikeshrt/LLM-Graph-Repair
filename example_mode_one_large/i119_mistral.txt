Here, the first operation is to update the existing allergy relationship between the patient and ingredient nodes to remove the oxycodone ingredient. The second operation is to delete the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship connecting the medicine and ingredient nodes. The third operation is to create a new Medicine node with the correct description but without an id (since we don't know the unique id for this corrected medication). The fourth operation is to establish a TAKES_MEDICATION relationship between the patient and the newly created Medicine node. Lastly, we assign a unique id to the new Medicine node. This repair suggests that Sanford861 stops taking the medicine containing oxycodone and starts taking a different medication with the same description but without oxycodone as an ingredient.
