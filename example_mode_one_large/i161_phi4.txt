This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient Isiah14 and the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet," which contains an ingredient, ferrous sulfate, to which Isiah14 is allergic. This ensures that Isiah14 does not take a medication containing an allergen.
