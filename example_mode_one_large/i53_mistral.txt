This set of repairs suggests removing the allergy relationship between Samatha845 and warfarin, updating the description of the medicine (Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet), adding a new medication node for Samatha845 that is not allergic to warfarin, and adding an alternative ingredient to the updated medicine node. The alternative ingredient should be distinct from warfarin to resolve the inconsistency.
