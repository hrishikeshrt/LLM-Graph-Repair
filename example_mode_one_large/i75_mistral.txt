Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Medicine and Ingredient for epoetin alfa, as Walker122 should not be taking a medicine containing this ingredient (DEL_EDGE | (rc)).
- Update the Patient node with no changes (UPD_NODE | (p)).
- Add a new Medicine node with the correct description and establish a TAKES_MEDICATION relationship with Walker122 (ADD_EDGE | (p)-[:TAKES_MEDICATION]-> (m)).
- Remove the existing ALLERGIC_TO relationship between Patient and Ingredient for epoetin alfa (DEL_EDGE | (ra)).
- Update the Ingredient node with a new id, as it should not be epoetin alfa anymore. This update is only applied to the ingredient that Walker122 is not allergic to (UPD_NODE | (i)).
