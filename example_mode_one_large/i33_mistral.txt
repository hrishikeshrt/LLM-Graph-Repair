Explanation: The current graph has a patient who takes a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. To fix this inconsistency, we should remove the relationship between the ingredient and the medicine (since it's not actually part of the medication) and update the medication node to ensure it doesn't have the problematic ingredient associated with it.
