This repair suggests removing the relationship between Medicine and Ingredient for oxycodone, updating the Patient node with no changes, and adding a new relationship between Patient and Ingredient indicating that the patient should not take oxycodone. This repair corrects the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient is not taking a medication containing an allergen.
