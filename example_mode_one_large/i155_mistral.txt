Explanation:
- Remove the existing allergy relationship between Isiah14 and ferrous sulfate (DEL_EDGE).
- Update the description of the current medication node to an empty string since it is not appropriate for use by Isiah14 (UPD_NODE).
- Create a new medication node with the correct description (ADD_NODE).
- Establish a new TAKES_MEDICATION relationship between Isiah14 and the new medication node (ADD_EDGE).
