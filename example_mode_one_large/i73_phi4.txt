This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient "Walker122" and the medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic. This ensures that the patient is not treated with a medicine containing an allergen, aligning with the requirement that patients should not be prescribed medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.
