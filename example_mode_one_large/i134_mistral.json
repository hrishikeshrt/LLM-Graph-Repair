To fix this, we first remove the existing relationship between the patient and the offending ingredient (DEL_EDGE on rm). Then, we update the properties of the offending ingredient node (UPD_NODE on i) since it doesn't change its state in the graph. Next, we add a new medicine node (ADD_NODE on m1), set its description to the original medication name and associate it with the patient (ADD_EDGE on p-[:TAKES_MEDICATION]->m1). Finally, we update the relationship between the patient and the new medicine node (UPD_EDGE on ra) to indicate that the patient is still allergic to something, but not to this specific medicine.",
