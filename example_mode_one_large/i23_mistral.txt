Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Medicine and Ingredient (rc) for oxycodone, as it is causing an inconsistency.
- Update the Patient node (p) with no property changes since the description of the inconsistency does not specify any changes to patient properties.
- Add a new relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes, indicating that Logan497 is NOT_ALLERGIC_TO oxycodone (ra1).
