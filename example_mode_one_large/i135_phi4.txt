This repair operation removes the relationship between the patient "Boyd728" and the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which contains an ingredient ("mestranol") to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen, resolving the inconsistency without needing additional changes.
