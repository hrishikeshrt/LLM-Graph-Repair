Explanation: The inconsistency is that a person (Walker122) takes a medicine (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) which contains an ingredient (epoetin alfa) and he is allergic to it. To fix this, we first remove the allergy relationship between Walker122 and epoetin alfa (DEL_EDGE). Then, we update the description property of the medicine taken by Walker122 to a different name (UPD_NODE), as we cannot simply remove the medicine since it might be a different one with the same ingredient. Lastly, we add a new medicine for Walker122 that does not contain epoetin alfa (ADD_EDGE). The new medicine's name should be specified by replacing "medication-name" in the example output above.
