This repair suggests replacing the allergenic medication with an alternative one that does not contain the allergenic ingredient. The repairs include removing the existing relationship between the patient and the allergenic ingredient, updating the patient's allergy list to be empty, adding a new node for the alternative ingredient, creating a relationship between the new medicine and the alternative ingredient, and finally, adding a relationship between the patient and the new alternative medication. The new medicine will have a different name and description to distinguish it from the original one.
