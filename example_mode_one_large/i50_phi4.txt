This repair operation removes the existing relationship where the patient Terrence276 is taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic. This ensures compliance with the rule that a person should not be treated with a medicine containing an allergen. The other relationships and nodes remain unchanged, as no alternative treatment or additional information was provided in the description.
