This repair operation suggests removing the relationship between the ingredient and the patient, updating the patient's allergy status for the specific ingredient, and adding a new NOT_ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient and the ingredient. This will correct the inconsistency while maintaining factual accuracy.
