Explanation:
- The inconsistency is that a patient named Logan497 takes a medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic. To resolve this, we remove the relationship where Logan497 takes the medication Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, as it contains oxycodone, an allergen for them. This ensures compliance with the rule that patients should not be treated with medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.
