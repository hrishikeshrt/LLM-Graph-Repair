This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient Weldon459 and the medication "verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet" because it contains an ingredient (naproxen) to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that the patient does not take a medicine containing an allergenic ingredient.
