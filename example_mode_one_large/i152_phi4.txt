This repair operation removes the existing relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient "Teddy976" and the medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic. This ensures that the inconsistency of a person taking a medicine with an allergen is resolved by simply removing the problematic relationship. No new nodes or relationships are added, as the solution focuses on eliminating the issue directly.
