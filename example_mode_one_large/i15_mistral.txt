This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between the patient and the allergenic ingredient, updating the properties of the relationships and nodes involved to reflect a new medication and non-allergenic ingredient. The new medication retains the original description but has a unique id, while the new ingredient has a unique id and a name that implies it is not allergenic for the patient.
