    </repairs>

This repair suggests removing the existing allergy relationship between Samatha845 and olmesartan, marking olmesartan as an allergen in the ingredient node, and does not suggest any new medication for Samatha845 since it is important to find a suitable alternative that does not contain olmesartan.
