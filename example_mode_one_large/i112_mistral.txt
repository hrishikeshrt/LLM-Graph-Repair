This repair suggests removing the allergy relationship between Sanford861 and oxycodone, updating the ingredient id for the existing edge connecting medication and ingredient to a different non-allergic ingredient, updating the description of the original medicine to exclude oxycodone, and adding a new TAKES_MEDICATION relationship with the updated medicine.
