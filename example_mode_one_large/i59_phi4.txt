Explanation:
- The inconsistency arises because a patient, "Sanford861," is taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic. To resolve this, we should remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication. This operation ensures that the graph reflects that "Sanford861" no longer takes the medication containing "ferrous sulfate."
