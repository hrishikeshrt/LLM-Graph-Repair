This repair operation removes the relationship between the patient "Walker122" and the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," which contains an ingredient ("epoetin alfa") to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that the patient is not treated with a medicine containing an allergen.
