This repair suggests removing the relationship between the medicine and the oxycodone ingredient, updating the medicine node without changing its properties, adding a new allergy for the patient to another allergen, and giving this new allergen a different name (another-allergen) and description (another allergen). This way, we remove the inconsistency while allowing the patient to have other allergies.
