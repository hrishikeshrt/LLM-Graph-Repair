This repair operation removes the existing relationship `:TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient "Samatha845" and the medication "Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG / Olmesartan medoxomil 20 MG Oral Tablet [Tribenzor]" to resolve the inconsistency where the medication contains an ingredient, olmesartan, to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that Samatha845 is not treated with a medicine containing an allergen.
