This repair operation deletes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient `Earle679` and the medication `Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension`, which contains an ingredient `mestranol` to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that the patient does not take a medicine containing an allergen, resolving the inconsistency.
