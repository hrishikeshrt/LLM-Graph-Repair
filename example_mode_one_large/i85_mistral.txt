This repair suggests updating the `allergic_to` relationship for the patient to reflect that they are no longer allergic to the ingredient, and removing the edge connecting the medicine to the ingredient (since it is incorrect). This allows the inconsistency to be resolved without altering the medication or adding new nodes.
