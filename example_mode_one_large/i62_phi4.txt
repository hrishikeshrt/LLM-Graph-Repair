This repair operation removes the existing relationship between the patient "Sanford861" and the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet," which contains an ingredient "ferrous sulfate" that the patient is allergic to. This ensures compliance with the requirement that a person should not be treated with a medicine containing an allergen they are sensitive to.
