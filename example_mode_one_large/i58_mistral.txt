Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medicine as the person is not supposed to take a medicine that contains an allergen.
- Update the Ingredient node to indicate it is not an allergen for the patient (setting `allergenic_to` to false).
- Add a new relationship between the Patient and Ingredient indicating that the patient is not allergic to this ingredient (using a `NOT_ALLERGIC_TO` label). This allows for future checks if the same medicine or other medicines containing this ingredient are considered.
