To resolve this, we should remove the relationship indicating that Boyd728 takes Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, as it contains mestranol, an allergen for the patient. This ensures compliance with the rule that patients should not be treated with medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.",
