This repair suggests the removal of the existing relationship between Patient and Medication, updating the allergy property for the patient to include "epoetin alfa", and adding a new relationship between the patient and the ingredient indicating allergy. Since the medication itself is incorrect, no modification or addition of a new medicine is necessary.
