This repair operation removes the relationship between the patient "Logan497" and the medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic, thus resolving the inconsistency. The `DEL_EDGE` operation targets the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship `(rm)` that connects the patient node with the medication node. No additional details are needed for this operation as it simply removes the existing edge.
