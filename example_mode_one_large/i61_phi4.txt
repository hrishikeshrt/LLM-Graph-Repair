Explanation:
- The inconsistency is that a patient named Sanford861 takes a medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic. To resolve this, we remove the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient and the medication, ensuring the patient does not continue taking it. No additional nodes or edges need to be added in this scenario.
