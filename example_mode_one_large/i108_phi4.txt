Explanation:
- The inconsistency is that a patient, Sanford861, takes medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, the relationship between the patient and the medication should be removed, as it would not be safe for them to take it. This is achieved by deleting the `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge `(rm)`. No new nodes or edges need to be added in this scenario since we're addressing a safety concern by removing an inappropriate connection.
