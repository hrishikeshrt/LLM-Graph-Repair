Explanation:
- The inconsistency arises because a patient "Isiah14" is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, we need to remove the relationship where the patient takes the problematic medication.
- `DEL_EDGE` operation is used to delete the edge `(rm:TAKES_MEDICATION)` between the patient node and the medication node containing the allergen. This prevents the patient from being treated with a medicine they are allergic to.
