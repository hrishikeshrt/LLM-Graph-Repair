Remove the existing relationship between the Medicine node and the Ingredient node (oxycodone), since it is causing an inconsistency.\n2. Update the Patient node to remove any reference to oxycodone as an allergy, as this may be a mistake or outdated information.\n3. Add a new Ingredient node with an id that differs from 'oxycodone' (to avoid the inconsistency), which is not allergic to the patient.\n4. Establish a new relationship between the Medicine node and the newly created Ingredient node (oxycodone-alternative).\n5. Update the Medicine node with a revised description that does not contain the allergen.",
