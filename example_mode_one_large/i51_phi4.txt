This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient Samatha845 and the medication Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet, which contains an ingredient that she is allergic to. This ensures compliance with the rule that a person should not be treated with a medicine containing an allergen they are sensitive to.
