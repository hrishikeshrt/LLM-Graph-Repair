Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Ingredient as the person is not supposed to be allergic to a medicine they are taking.
- Remove the existing relationship between Medicine and Ingredient, as the current medicine should not contain the allergen.
- Add a new Medicine node with the correct description.
- Establish a new relationship between Patient and the new Medicine.
- Update the Ingredient node to remove the incorrect association with the patient (as the patient is no longer allergic to this medicine).
- Establish a new relationship between the new Medicine and the updated Ingredient.
- Update the Patient node to reflect the correct allergy information.
