Explanation:
- Remove the relationship between the medicine and oxycodone ingredient as this is the inconsistent edge.
- Update the patient node without changing any properties as it was not the cause of the inconsistency but needs to be involved in the repair process for future consistency checks.
- Add a new non-allergenic ingredient that the patient is not allergic to, allowing the patient to take alternative medications.
- Add an alternative medication that does not contain oxycodone as the allergen. This will ensure that the patient can be treated without causing further inconsistencies.
