This repair suggests removing the existing relationships between Isiah14, the medication, and the ingredient since they are inconsistent. A new medication node is added with the correct description, and Isiah14's allergies property is updated to exclude ferrous sulfate. Finally, a new relationship is established between Isiah14 and the newly created medication node.
