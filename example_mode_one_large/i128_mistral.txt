Explanation:
- Update the existing edge `rc` to remove the relationship between the current medicine and the allergenic ingredient, as they should not be connected.
- Delete the existing edge `ra` connecting the patient with the allergenic ingredient, as a person should not be allergic to an ingredient they are not taking.
- Update the node `p` to ensure the first name is consistent.
- Add a new medicine node `m1` with the correct description and generate a unique id for it.
- Delete the existing edge connecting the allergenic ingredient with the current medicine, as it should not be part of the medicine's ingredients.
- Create a new edge connecting the patient with the newly created medicine `m1`.
