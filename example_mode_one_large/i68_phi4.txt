This repair operation removes the relationship between the patient "Walker122" and the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," which contains an ingredient "epoetin alfa" to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen, addressing the inconsistency described.
