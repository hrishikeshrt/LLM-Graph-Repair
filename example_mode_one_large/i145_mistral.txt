This repair suggests removing the relationship between Olmesartan and Samatha845 (ra), since she should not be allergic to it. It also removes the relationship between Olmesartan and the medication Tribenzor (rc), as the ingredient is no longer associated with that medicine. Finally, it adds a new alternative medication for Samatha845 (m1) and establishes a relationship between her and this new medication (rm).
