Explanation:
- The inconsistency is that a patient, Sanford861, is taking a medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic. 
- To resolve this, we remove the relationship where Sanford861 takes the medication Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, as it contains oxycodone, an allergen for them. This ensures compliance with the rule that patients should not take medications containing ingredients they're allergic to.
