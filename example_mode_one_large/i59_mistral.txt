Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medicine (rm) as it is inconsistent.
- Mark ferrous sulfate as an allergenic ingredient (i).
- Add a new Allergic_to relationship between Patient and ferrous sulfate (i).
- Remove the existing Allergic_to relationship between Patient and Ingredient (ra) since it is no longer applicable.
- Mark the original medication as having no ingredients (m).
- Create an alternative medicine with a new name, which the patient can take instead (m1).
