This repair suggests removing the relationship between the medicine and oxycodone, updating the patient's allergies to a safe ingredient (not oxycodone), and adding a new medicine that does not contain oxycodone as an ingredient. The new medicine should have a different name than 1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection.
