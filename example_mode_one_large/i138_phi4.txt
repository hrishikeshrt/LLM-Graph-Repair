Explanation:
- The inconsistency is that a patient named Weldon459, who is allergic to an ingredient with id "naproxen", is taking medication containing this ingredient. 
- To resolve this, the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient and the medication should be removed, as it violates the rule that patients should not take medications they are allergic to.
