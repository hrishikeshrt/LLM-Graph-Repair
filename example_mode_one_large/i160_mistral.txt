This repair suggests removing the inconsistent relationship between Isiah14 and ferrous sulfate, updating the allergicTo property of ferrous sulfate to an empty array (since it should no longer be considered an allergen for Isiah14), and adding a new ALLERGIC_TO relationship between Isiah14 and ferrous sulfate. This repair assumes that there is a way to remove an ingredient from the list of allergens for a patient in your graph model, if not, you may need to adjust the repair accordingly.
