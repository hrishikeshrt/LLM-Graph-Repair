**Explanation:**

The inconsistency arises because a patient, Logan497, is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, we should remove the relationship where Logan497 takes the problematic medication containing oxycodone. This ensures compliance with the rule that patients should not be treated with medications containing ingredients they are allergic to. The operation `DEL_EDGE` removes the existing `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between Logan497 and the medication Epogen, which contains oxycodone. No additional nodes or edges need to be added or modified for this repair.
