Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. The problem is that a person is taking a medication which contains an ingredient they're allergic to. This should be caught because it's unsafe for them to take both.

Looking at the graph query, there are two relationships: TAKES_MEDICATION and HAS_INGREDIENT, both connecting to the same ingredient node 'i'. So, the patient (p) is taking a medication (m), which has an ingredient (i) that p is allergic to. This duplication could cause confusion or errors in the system.

I think the first step is to remove one of these relationships so that there's only one connection between the patient and the medication via the shared ingredient. That way, it's clear that the medication contains an allergen they can't handle.

So, I'll delete the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship because the HAS_INGREDIENT one already links them through 'i'. This should prevent any issues arising from having both relationships present.
