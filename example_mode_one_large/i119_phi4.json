To resolve this, the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient and the problematic medication should be removed. This ensures compliance with the requirement that patients should not take medications containing ingredients to which they are allergic. No other changes are necessary as removing this specific edge resolves the inconsistency without further action needed on nodes or other edges.",
