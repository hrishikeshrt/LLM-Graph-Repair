This repair suggests removing the existing edge between the Medicine node and Oxycodone ingredient, as well as the edge between Patient and Oxycodone. It also updates the description of the Medicine node to an empty string to reflect the change in medication. Finally, it adds a new edge between the Medicine node and a new Ingredient node with a non-allergenic name.
