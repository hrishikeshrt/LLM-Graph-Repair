Then, the allergy property of the ingredient is updated to \"false\", indicating that the patient is no longer allergic to it. Finally, a new relationship is added between the patient and the ingredient (verapamil hydrochloride), reflecting the correct state that the patient is now allergic to this ingredient.",
