To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient is not allergic to an ingredient present in a medication they are taking. The inconsistency arises because the patient takes a medication containing oxycodone but is also listed as being allergic to it.

Here's how we can resolve this:

1. **Remove the allergy relationship** between the patient and the ingredient (oxycodone) since the patient should not be allergic to an ingredient in a medication they are taking.

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>
```

This operation removes the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship, resolving the inconsistency.
