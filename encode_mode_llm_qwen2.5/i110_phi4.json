  "content": "The inconsistency described involves a patient who takes a medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic. Specifically, the patient Sanford Fritsch takes \"1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection\" and is allergic to oxycodone. However, there is no indication that oxycodone is an ingredient in Epogen.\n\nTo resolve this inconsistency, we need to ensure that the allergy relationship does not exist if oxycodone is not an ingredient of the medication taken by the patient.\n\nSuggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [ra] | -\n</repairs>\n\nThis operation removes the allergic reaction relationship between the patient and oxycodone, as there is no factual basis for this allergy given the medication's ingredients.",
