This repair suggests updating the Medication node with ID 205923 to have a different code, and removing the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between Medication and Ingredient for oxycodone. This change is necessary because oxycodone is listed as an allergy for the patient, but it should not be present as an ingredient in any medication that the patient takes.
