The provided patient data has an incorrect birth and death date. To fix this, we update the node with id 'p'. Additionally, since the patient was reported to have an allergy to oxycodone but there is no oxycodone ingredient in our graph, we add a new node for oxycodone and create an edge between it and the patient.
