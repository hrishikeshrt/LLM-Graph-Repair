This repair suggests that we update the Medication node with the correct name and code, add a new TAKES_MEDICATION relationship for the corrected medication with the correct start date, remove the incorrect HAS_INGREDIENT edge, add a new Ingredient node for Epogen, and create a new HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between the corrected Medication and the new Ingredient. This way, we ensure that the patient is only taking the medication without oxycodone as an ingredient.
