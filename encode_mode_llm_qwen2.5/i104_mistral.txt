This repair suggests that the ingredient for HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet should be updated to hydrochlorothiazide, and a new ingredient with code 310798 is added as an ingredient of this medication. This corrects the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient is not allergic to an ingredient they are taking.
