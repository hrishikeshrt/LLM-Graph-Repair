Okay, I need to figure out how to fix the inconsistency described. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user has a patient with ID 3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d who is taking medication 860975, which is "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet". The medication has an ingredient called ferrous sulfate as an allergen. However, the medication itself contains ferrous sulfate as a component, not necessarily as an allergen.

So, looking at the graph query, there's a relationship [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] between the medication and the ingredient. But this is incorrect because the medication has ferrous sulfate as its active ingredient, which shouldn't be listed as an allergy in this context.

To fix this, I should remove the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship for this specific case. That way, the medication won't incorrectly list the ingredient as an allergen when it's actually part of the medication.
