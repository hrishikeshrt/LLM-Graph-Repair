The inconsistency in this scenario arises from a patient being both taking a medication and having an allergy to one of its ingredients. Specifically, the patient takes a medication containing epoetin alfa but is also allergic to it.

To resolve this issue factually:

1. **Remove the relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to the ingredient** (epoetin alfa) found in the medication they are taking, as it's inconsistent for them to be both taking and allergic to the same substance without additional context or clarification.
