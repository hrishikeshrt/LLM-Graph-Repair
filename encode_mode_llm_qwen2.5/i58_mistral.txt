    ADD_NODE | [i] | {id: "-", code: "ferrous sulfate"}
   </repairs>

   The first repair updates the patient node with the correct birthdate and last name. The second repair adds a new relationship between the patient and the ferrous sulfate ingredient, as the patient is allergic to it. Lastly, a new node for the ferrous sulfate ingredient is created, but without an ID since it's not specified in the provided information.
