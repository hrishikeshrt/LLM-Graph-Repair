Therefore, there should be no `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient oxycodone.\n\nSuggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [ra] | -\n</repairs> \n\nThis operation removes the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient node, resolving the inconsistency.",
