Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there's a patient with ID 3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d. This patient is taking a medication called "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" with code 205923, starting from June 26, 2016. The medication has an ingredient listed as oxycodone.

But then there's another edge indicating that the patient is allergic to oxycodone. That seems contradictory because if someone takes a medication containing oxycodone and is also marked as allergic, that doesn't make sense. Allergies shouldn't apply to the medication itself but to the person taking it.

Looking at the graph structure, there are two relationships from the patient (p) to the ingredient (i): one via [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] and another via [ra:ALLERGIC_TO]. This duplication is causing the inconsistency because the same ingredient can't be both present in a medication someone takes and marked as an allergy they have.

So, I think the solution here is to remove the [ra:ALLERGIC_TO] relationship. That way, the patient's allergy to oxycodone isn't incorrectly linked to their medication intake. This should eliminate the inconsistency without affecting other parts of the graph.
