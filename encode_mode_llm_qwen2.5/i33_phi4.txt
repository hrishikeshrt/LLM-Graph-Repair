The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises because the patient, who is allergic to oxycodone, is taking a medication that contains oxycodone as an ingredient. This situation poses a potential health risk and should be addressed by correcting the data.

Suggested repairs:

1. Remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing oxycodone.
2. Alternatively, if it's confirmed that the allergy information is incorrect, remove the allergy edge instead.

Given the critical nature of allergies, we will assume the allergy information is correct and suggest removing the medication-taking relationship.
