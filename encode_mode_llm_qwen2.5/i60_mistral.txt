   To fix the inconsistency, it is necessary to update the birthdate of the patient and add a new edge connecting the patient to the correct allergen (ferrous sulfate) with the appropriate label `ALLERGIC_TO`. Since there was no information provided about the current properties of the allergen node, I assumed that its name is "Ferrous Sulfate". If this assumption is incorrect, please provide the actual name for the update.
