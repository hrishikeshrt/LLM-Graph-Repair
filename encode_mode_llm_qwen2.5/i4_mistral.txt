This repair suggests updating the patient's birthdate and passedAway properties, adding a new medication for the patient that starts on January 24, 2018 (as the original medication ended in 1986), and updating the code of the medication to "exemestane 25 MG Oral Tablet". The allergy information is not corrected as the patient's stated allergy seems consistent with the provided data.
