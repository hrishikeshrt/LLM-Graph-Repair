To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient is not taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. In this case, the patient is taking "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" and is allergic to oxycodone. We must verify if oxycodone is indeed an ingredient of the medication.

Assuming that oxycodone is not an ingredient of "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," the inconsistency lies in the allergy relationship, as there should be no direct allergy link between the patient and oxycodone if it's not present in their medication.

Here are the suggested repairs:
