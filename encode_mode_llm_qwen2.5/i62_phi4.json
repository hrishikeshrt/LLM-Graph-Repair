However, to ensure completeness and accuracy, we can consider adding missing date information for the allergy record if that aligns with your data model requirements.\n\nHere is a suggested repair:\n\n```xml\n<repairs>\n    UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {start_date: \"2006-09-15\", end_date: NULL}\n</repairs>\n```\n\nThis assumes you want to mark the end date of the allergy as ongoing (null) after the medication stop date. Adjust according to your specific requirements or data model.",
