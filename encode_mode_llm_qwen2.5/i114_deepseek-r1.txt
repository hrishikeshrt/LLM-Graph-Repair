Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, we have a patient who takes a medication and has an ingredient in it. The problem seems to be that both the "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship and the "HAS_INGREDIENT" relationship are pointing from the medication node (205923) back to the ingredient node (oxycodone). 

Wait, but if the patient takes a medication, the medication should have an edge going out to the patient. Similarly, for ingredients, each ingredient in a medication should point from the medication to the ingredient. But here, both edges are coming into the medication, which doesn't make sense.

So, maybe we need to reverse those relationships. Instead of medication having edges pointing back to the patient and the ingredient, the patient has an edge pointing to the medication, and each ingredient in that medication points from the medication to itself as a component.

That way, the data model becomes consistent: patients take medications, which contain ingredients. So, we should add those relationships correctly.
