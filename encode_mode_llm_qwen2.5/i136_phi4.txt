Based on the description, the inconsistency arises because the patient Weldon Effertz is allergic to naproxen but not to verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG oral tablet. However, since verapamil contains naproxen as an ingredient, there should be an allergy relationship between the patient and verapamil.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Add an `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient Weldon Effertz and the medication Verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG oral tablet to reflect the indirect allergy through naproxen.
