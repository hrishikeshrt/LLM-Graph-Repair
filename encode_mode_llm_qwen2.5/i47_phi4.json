Since no specific start or stop dates for the allergy are provided, it's crucial to maintain the integrity of the graph by keeping the allergy relationship but ensuring all relevant information is correctly captured.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nUPD_EDGE | [ra] | {start_date: \"unknown\", end_date: \"unknown\"}\n</repairs>\n\nThis operation updates the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship to include unspecified start and end dates for the allergy, maintaining factual accuracy without removing critical health information.",
