To address the inconsistency, we need to identify whether the patient's allergy to mestranol is correctly represented in the graph. The inconsistency arises because the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" does not contain mestranol as an ingredient. Therefore, the relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to mestranol due to this medication should be removed.
