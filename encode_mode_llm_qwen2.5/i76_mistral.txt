Explanation: The patient's birth and death dates are correct, but the medication and allergy information need to be updated. We update the patient node with the provided birth and death dates. Then we add a new edge between the patient and the medication, specifying the type of relationship as "TAKES_MEDICATION" and providing the medication details. Next, we update the medication node with the correct code. Finally, since there is no allergy to the correct medication (Epogen), we remove the existing allergy edge.
