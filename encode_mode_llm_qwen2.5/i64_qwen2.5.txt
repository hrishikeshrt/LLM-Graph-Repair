UPD_NODE | p | {allergies: ["ferrous sulfate", "metformin"]} 
</repairs>

Explanation: The patient's existing allergy to "ferrous sulfate" is correct, but the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" contains metformin as an ingredient. Therefore, we need to update the patient node to include the additional allergy to metformin.
