The inconsistency described involves a patient who is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. The specific issue is that the patient has an allergy to oxycodone, but there is no indication in the description of the graph pattern that the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" (code 205923) actually contains oxycodone as an ingredient.

To address this inconsistency, we need to verify whether the medication indeed contains oxycodone. If it does not, then the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and oxycodone should be removed. If it does contain oxycodone, no action is needed regarding the allergy information.

Assuming that "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" does not contain oxycodone (as there is no indication in the description), the repair operation would be:
