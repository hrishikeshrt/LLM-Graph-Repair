The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves a patient who is both taking a medication containing an ingredient and being allergic to that same ingredient. The specific issue arises because the patient started and stopped taking the medication on December 21, 1975, which is after their death date of March 19, 1977. This indicates that the patient could not have been taking the medication during their lifetime.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication, as it is factually incorrect given the timeline.
