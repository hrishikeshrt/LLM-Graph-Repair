The inconsistency described involves a patient who is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. This situation suggests a potential issue with either the medication's ingredients or the allergy record. To resolve this, we need to ensure that the patient is not taking a medication containing an allergen.

### Suggested Repairs

1. **Remove the relationship between the medication and the ingredient** if it is incorrect:
   - If the medication HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet does not actually contain exemestane as an ingredient, we should remove this incorrect relationship.

2. **Update the allergy record** if the patient is no longer allergic to the ingredient:
   - If the patient's allergy to exemestane is outdated or incorrect, update their allergy status.
