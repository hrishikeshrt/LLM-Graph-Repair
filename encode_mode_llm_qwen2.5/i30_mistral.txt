This repair suggests updating the patient's birth and death dates, adding a new medication node with the correct code and name for the specified medication, creating a relationship between the patient and the medication, removing the incorrect ingredient relationship, adding a new ingredient relationship for Epoetin alfa (the active ingredient in Epogen), and setting the ingredient's name accordingly.
