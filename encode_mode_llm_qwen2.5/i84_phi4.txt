The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the patient being both taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. This situation suggests either the allergy or the medication's ingredients need correction.

1. **Verify Allergy**: If the patient is indeed allergic to epoetin alfa, then there is no issue with the allergy data itself.
2. **Verify Medication Ingredients**: Check if "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" correctly lists epoetin alfa as an ingredient.

Assuming the medication's ingredients are incorrect (since it's unlikely for a patient to knowingly take a medication they're allergic to without medical oversight), we need to correct the medication's ingredient list.

This operation removes the incorrect relationship indicating that "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" contains epoetin alfa, assuming this is the inconsistency.
