   Here is a suggested repair plan to fix the inconsistency. The patient's birth and death dates are corrected, an allergy edge is added for oxycodone, and a takes_medication edge is added for the medication with its properties updated. Additionally, a new ingredient node is created for the medication, as no existing ingredient matches the provided information.
