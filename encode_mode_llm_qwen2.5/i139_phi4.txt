To address the inconsistency where a patient, Weldon Effertz744, takes verapamil hydrochloride but is also allergic to naproxen, we need to verify whether these medications and ingredients are correctly linked. The issue arises if the ingredient of verapamil hydrochloride (which should not include naproxen) is incorrectly associated with naproxen as an allergen.

Assuming that the medication "verapamil hydrochloride" does not contain "naproxen" as an ingredient, we need to correct this inconsistency by removing the incorrect allergy relationship. Here are the suggested repairs:

This operation removes the erroneous allergic reaction relationship between Weldon Effertz744 and naproxen, assuming that verapamil hydrochloride does not contain naproxen as an ingredient. If further verification is needed to ensure the correct ingredients for each medication, additional checks should be performed on the graph data.
