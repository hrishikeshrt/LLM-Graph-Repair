This repair suggests updating the patient's birth and death dates, adding a new relationship between the patient and the medication with appropriate properties, and adding a new relationship between the patient and the ingredient with the name "exemestane". The existing relationships for the patient with the medication and ingredient are not removed because they accurately represent the fact that the patient took the medication at one point in time and is allergic to exemestane.
