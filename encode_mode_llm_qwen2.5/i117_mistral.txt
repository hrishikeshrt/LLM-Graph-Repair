   UPD_NODE | [i] | {code: 'oxycodone'}
   DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the ingredient node with the correct code 'oxycodone' and removing the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient, as the patient should not have an allergy to oxycodone if they are taking a medication that contains it.
