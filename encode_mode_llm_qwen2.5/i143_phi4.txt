The inconsistency described involves a patient, Samatha845, who is allergic to olmesartan and is taking a medication that contains olmesartan as an ingredient. This situation presents a factual risk since the patient should not be prescribed a medication containing an allergen.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. The relationship indicating the allergy to olmesartan should remain intact.
2. The relationship between the patient and the medication they are taking should be removed, as it is unsafe for the patient to continue taking Tribenzor due to their allergy to one of its ingredients.

Here are the suggested repairs:
