The inconsistency described indicates that a patient, Sanford Fritsch, is allergic to oxycodone, which is also listed as an ingredient in a medication he takes. This presents a factual risk or contradiction because the patient should not be taking a medication containing an allergen.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to ensure that either:
1. The relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication with oxycodone is removed if it's incorrect.
2. The relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to oxycodone is removed if it's incorrect.

Assuming the allergy information is correct (as allergies are generally critical health concerns), we should remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes a medication containing an allergen.

Here are the suggested repairs:
