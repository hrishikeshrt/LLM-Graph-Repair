Explanation: The patient is taking the medication Epogen, which should be represented as a new node with its properties (code, dosage, concentration, and injection). Then, the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship should be updated to reflect that the ingredient of the medication is the newly created Epogen node. Lastly, the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship needs to have the correct start date for the medication prescription.
