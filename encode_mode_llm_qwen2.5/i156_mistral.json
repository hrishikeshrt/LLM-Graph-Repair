To fix this inconsistency, we remove the relationship between the medication and ferrous sulfate (`DEL_EDGE`) and add a new relationship between the correct medication and ferrous sulfate (`ADD_EDGE`). Additionally, since it's not clear which medication has ferrous sulfate as an ingredient, we update the properties of the node representing ferrous sulfate to include its code.",
