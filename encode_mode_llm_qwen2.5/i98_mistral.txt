Explanation: The patient's birthdate and deathdate are not consistent with the ingredient's existence. We assume that the allergy to mestranol was acquired after the patient's birth, so we update the allergen's birthdate to a later year (e.g., 1947). Also, the medication prescription for Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension started on March 7, 2006, and ended on March 21, 2006, not in the years mentioned in the description.
