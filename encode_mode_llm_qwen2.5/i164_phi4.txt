To address the inconsistency, we need to ensure that Kendal125 is not allergic to an ingredient found in a medication they are taking. The inconsistency arises because Kendal125 takes Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension and is also allergic to mestranol, which should not be an ingredient of this medication.

Assuming mestranol is indeed not an ingredient of Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, the repair involves removing the incorrect allergy relationship:

DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -

This operation deletes the relationship indicating that Kendal125 is allergic to mestranol.
