The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that a patient who is allergic to oxycodone is also taking a medication that contains oxycodone as an ingredient. This situation poses a health risk and should be addressed by removing the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen.

To resolve this, we need to remove the edge representing the "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship between the patient and the medication containing oxycodone.
