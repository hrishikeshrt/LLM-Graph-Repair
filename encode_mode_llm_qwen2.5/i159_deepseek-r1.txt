Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The user provided a Cypher query that matches a patient (p) taking a medication (rm), which is connected to another medication (m), and then there's an allergic relationship (ra) from the patient to an ingredient (i). The problem is with a specific patient named Isiah Fritsch. 

He takes "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" from May 27, 1989, to July 1, 1989. But he's also allergic to ferrous sulfate. However, the graph shows that his medication is linked via rm to another medication (m), and both are connected through rc to their respective ingredients.

Wait a minute, I think there might be confusion in the graph structure here. The patient is taking one medication, but the graph seems to connect it to another medication (m). That doesn't make sense because "24 HR Glucophage" should only be linked once. So maybe the rm relationship shouldn't have both properties: taken_from and has_ingredient.

Also, the allergic_to relationship [ra] is pointing from the patient directly to the ingredient (i), but in the query, it's connected through m via rc. That might not align correctly because if the patient is only taking one medication, then the ra should be between p and i, not involving another node.

So, I think the main issues are:
1. The rm relationship has two properties: taken_from and has_ingredient. It shouldn't have both; each relationship should represent a single property.
2. The ra relationship is connected through m via rc, but it's more direct to connect p to i with ra.

Therefore, the repairs needed are:
- Remove the taken_from property from rm because each relationship should only handle one aspect.
- Add an explicit allergic_to relationship directly between p and i without going through m.

ADD_RELATIONSHIP | [rm] | {property: 'has_ingredient'}
DEL_PROPERTY | [rm] | {property: 'taken_from'}
UPD_RELATIONSHIP | [ra] | -
