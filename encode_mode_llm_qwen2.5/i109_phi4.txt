The inconsistency arises because the patient is allergic to oxycodone, yet they are taking a medication that contains oxycodone as an ingredient. To resolve this issue, we need to address either the allergy or the medication intake.

Here are two possible repair options:

Option 1: Remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication containing oxycodone.
```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>
```

Option 2: Remove the allergy relationship if it was mistakenly recorded (assuming the allergy information is incorrect).
```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>
```

Choose one of these options based on whether the medication intake or the allergy record should be corrected.
