The inconsistency described indicates that a patient, Logan Brekke497, who is allergic to oxycodone, has an ingredient relationship with oxycodone due to taking a medication. This suggests an error in the graph where the allergy and ingredient relationships are both present for oxycodone.

To resolve this inconsistency, we should remove the incorrect ingredient relationship between the medication and oxycodone, as it contradicts the patient's known allergy.
