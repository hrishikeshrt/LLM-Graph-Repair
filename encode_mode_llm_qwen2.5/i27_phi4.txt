To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient's allergy does not conflict with any medication they are taking. In this case, the patient has an allergy to oxycodone, but there is no indication that the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" contains oxycodone as an ingredient.

Given the information:

- The patient is taking a medication (code 205923) with the description "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection".
- The patient has an allergy to oxycodone.
- There is no mention of oxycodone being an ingredient in the medication they are taking.

The inconsistency arises if there is an incorrect assumption or data entry that suggests a conflict. Since the medication does not contain oxycodone, we need to ensure that any erroneous relationship indicating such a conflict is removed.
