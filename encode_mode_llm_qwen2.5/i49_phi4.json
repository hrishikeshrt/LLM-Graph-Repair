Specifically, the patient is allergic to exemestane, but there is no mention of exemestane being an ingredient in HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet.\n\nAssuming that exemestane is indeed not an ingredient in HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet, we should remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient.\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [ra] | -\n</repairs>",
