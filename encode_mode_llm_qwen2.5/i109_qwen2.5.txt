UPD_NODE | (p) | {remove property :birth_date}
</repairs> 

This suggestion assumes that the patient's birth date should not be used in this context, as the patient is allergic to oxycodone and takes a medication containing it, which is logically inconsistent. However, without more specific information on what the correct birth date should be or if it should be removed entirely, this is the most appropriate repair based on the given description.
