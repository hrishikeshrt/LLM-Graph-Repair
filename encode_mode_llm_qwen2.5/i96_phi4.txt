To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient's allergy does not conflict with their medication. The patient is allergic to an ingredient (mestranol) but takes a medication (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension) that should not contain this allergen.

Here are the suggested repairs:

1. **Remove the relationship indicating the patient is allergic to mestranol** if it's confirmed that Humulin 70/30 does not contain mestranol as an ingredient. This assumes the allergy information is incorrect or outdated.

2. **Update the medication's ingredients** if mestranol is incorrectly listed as an ingredient of Humulin 70/30.

Given the description, we will assume the allergy information is incorrect:

If further investigation reveals that Humulin 70/30 does contain mestranol and this needs correction in the graph:
