To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient Moises22 Kerluke267 does not have an allergy to mestranol while taking a medication containing it. Since the patient has passed away and was on Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension during the specified period, which contains insulin (not mestranol), the allergy relationship is incorrect.
