   The first repair updates the start date of the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship for patient 3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d. The second repair updates the code property of the node representing oxycodone (the ingredient). The third repair deletes the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship connecting oxycodone and the medication taken by the patient. The fourth repair adds a NOT_TAKES_MEDICATION relationship between the patient and the medication, indicating that the patient does not take this medication due to its allergenic ingredient.
