The inconsistency arises because the patient is allergic to oxycodone, yet there is a `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship indicating that the medication they take contains oxycodone. This situation suggests an error in either the allergy or ingredient data.

To resolve this, we can consider two potential repairs:

1. If the allergy information is incorrect and the patient is not actually allergic to oxycodone, then the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship should be removed.
2. If the medication indeed contains oxycodone as an ingredient but the patient's allergy record is correct, it suggests a need for caution or review by healthcare professionals rather than a direct graph repair.

Assuming the first scenario (incorrect allergy information), here are the suggested repairs:

If further investigation confirms that the ingredient data is incorrect and oxycodone should not be listed as an ingredient, then the following repair would apply:
