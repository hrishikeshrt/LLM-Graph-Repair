Explanation: The patient Cassandra O'Reilly is allergic to chlorthalidone but it has an error status. Therefore, update the allergy status of chlorthalidone and add an allergy relationship between Cassandra O'Reilly and chlorthalidone. Also, remove the incorrect ingredient relationship between Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet and chlorthalidone.
