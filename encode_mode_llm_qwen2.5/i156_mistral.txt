   </repairs>

Explanation: The patient takes a medication with code 860975, but ferrous sulfate is also listed as an ingredient in one of the medications the patient takes. To fix this inconsistency, we remove the relationship between the medication and ferrous sulfate (`DEL_EDGE`) and add a new relationship between the correct medication and ferrous sulfate (`ADD_EDGE`). Additionally, since it's not clear which medication has ferrous sulfate as an ingredient, we update the properties of the node representing ferrous sulfate to include its code.
