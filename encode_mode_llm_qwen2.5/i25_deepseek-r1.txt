Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The problem describes a patient who has both an allergy and a medication involving the same ingredient 'oxycodone'. But wait, oxycodone is typically an opioid, often found in painkillers like morphine or hydrocodone. Epogen, on the other hand, sounds more like a plateletpheresis product used in hemophilia. That seems odd because Epogen doesn't contain oxycodone.

Looking at the graph structure, there's a relationship `ra:ALLERGIC_TO` connecting the patient to 'oxycodone', and another `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT` from the medication to 'oxycodone'. So both relationships point to the same ingredient. But if Epogen doesn't have oxycodone, this might be incorrect.

I think the issue here is that the medication's ingredients are being incorrectly linked to oxycodone. Since Epogen probably doesn't contain it, we should remove that edge so the graph accurately reflects reality.
