To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient's allergy and medication intake are consistent with each other. The patient is allergic to clopidogrel, which is an ingredient in Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet. However, the patient took this medication during a period when they were alive and recorded as taking it.

The inconsistency arises because the patient should not be taking a medication containing an allergen. Therefore, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication.
