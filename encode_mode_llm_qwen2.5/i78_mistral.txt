   The first set of repairs updates the patient's birth and death dates, adds a new node for the date of death, and modifies the start date of the medication taken by the patient. The second set of repairs removes the allergy edge between the patient and ingredient, creates a new node for the ingredient epoetin alfa, and adds an edge connecting the medication to the ingredient with the appropriate quantity.
