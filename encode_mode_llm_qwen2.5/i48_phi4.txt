The inconsistency described involves a patient who is allergic to an ingredient that is part of a medication they are taking. The specific issue is that the patient, Goodwin, takes HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet, which contains exemestane as an ingredient. However, Goodwin has an allergy to exemestane.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to address the relationship indicating the allergy to exemestane since it should not exist if the medication containing this ingredient is being taken by the patient without known adverse reactions. The logical repair would be to remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient exemestane.
