To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient with ID `cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1` does not have an allergy to oxycodone if they are taking a medication containing it. Since the patient is allergic to oxycodone and also takes a medication with this ingredient, we need to remove the allergy relationship.
