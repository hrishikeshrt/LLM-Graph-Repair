      UPD_NODE | (i:Ingredient {id: "fluticasone"}) | {allergens: false}
      UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {startDate: "July 19, 1999", endDate: "June 30, 2005"}
   </repairs>

The first repair operation updates the ingredient node's `allergens` property to `false`, as it appears that Altha90 is not actually allergic to fluticasone. The second repair operation modifies the edge connecting Altha90 and fluticasone (node variable [ra]) by setting the start date to July 19, 1999, which matches the patient's birthdate, and the end date to June 30, 2005, as it seems that the medication was not taken after this date.
