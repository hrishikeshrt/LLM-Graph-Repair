Explanation: The patient's birthdate and deathdate are correct. However, the medication the patient is taking does not seem to have oxycodone as an ingredient. Instead, it appears that the patient has an allergy to oxycodone, but this information should be removed because the patient is not allergic to the medication they are actually taking (which is Epogen). To fix the inconsistency, we update the patient's properties, remove the incorrect allergy edge, add a new node for the correct ingredient (oxytocin), and create a new edge between the medication and the correct ingredient.
