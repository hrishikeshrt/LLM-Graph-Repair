The inconsistency described involves a patient who is allergic to an ingredient, mestranol, which is indicated by a medication ID rather than being directly associated with an Ingredient node. The patient is also taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, but there's no indication that this medication contains mestranol.

To resolve the inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to mestranol via the medication ID.
2. Ensure that the allergy information directly relates to an Ingredient node.
