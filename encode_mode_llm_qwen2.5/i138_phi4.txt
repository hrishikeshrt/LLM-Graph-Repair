The inconsistency described involves a patient who takes verapamil hydrochloride and is also allergic to naproxen. The issue arises because there is no direct connection between verapamil hydrochloride and naproxen in terms of ingredients, yet the patient's allergy to naproxen suggests an indirect relationship that should be addressed.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to ensure that the graph accurately reflects that the patient is allergic to an ingredient present in a medication they are taking. Since verapamil hydrochloride does not contain naproxen as an ingredient, the allergy information might be incorrect or misattributed.

Here's how we can address this:

1. **Remove the incorrect allergy relationship**: The patient should not have an allergy to naproxen if it is not present in any medication they are taking.
