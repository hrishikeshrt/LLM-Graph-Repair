The inconsistency in this scenario arises from the fact that the patient has an allergy to oxycodone, but the medication they are taking, described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," does not contain oxycodone. Therefore, there should be no `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient oxycodone.
