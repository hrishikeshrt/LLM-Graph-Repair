Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. The user provided a Cypher query that seems to have an issue with a patient's allergy and medication relationships.

First, I'll look at the original code:

MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
    (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
RETURN *

The problem is that the patient Altha90 is both taking a medication and allergic to an ingredient. But in reality, if someone is allergic to an ingredient, they shouldn't be taking that medication because it contains the allergen.

So, I need to remove any relationship where a patient is both taking a medication (rm) and allergic to its ingredient (rc). That means deleting either the rm or rc edge for each such case.

I'll use DEL_EDGE to remove the rm relationship. This way, Altha90 won't be linked to the medication anymore because she's allergic to one of its components.
