The inconsistency identified in the description suggests that a patient who takes a medication containing an ingredient is also allergic to that same ingredient. This scenario indicates a potential factual error, as it would be unusual for a patient to take a medication if they are known to be allergic to one of its ingredients.

To resolve this inconsistency, we can consider removing the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient. This assumes that the allergy information is incorrect or outdated in the context of the current medication regimen.
