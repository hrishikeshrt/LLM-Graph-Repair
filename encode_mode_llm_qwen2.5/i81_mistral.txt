This repair suggests updating the patient's birth and death dates, adding a relationship between the patient and medication with the correct code (205923), updating the medication node to have the correct name (Epoetin alfa) and adding a relationship between the medication and ingredient node (epoetin alfa). This repair assumes that the error lies in the incorrect information provided for the patient, medication, and/or ingredient, not the fact that the patient is allergic to the medication.
