To address the inconsistency described, we need to consider that a patient who is allergic to an ingredient should not be taking medication containing that ingredient. In this case, the patient is taking a medication and is also allergic to oxycodone.

Given the graph pattern:
- The patient takes a medication (`TAKES_MEDICATION`).
- This medication has ingredients (`HAS_INGREDIENT`).
- The patient is allergic to an ingredient (`ALLERGIC_TO`).

The inconsistency arises if any of the ingredients in the medication include oxycodone, which the patient is allergic to.

### Suggested Repairs

1. **Remove the relationship between the patient and the medication** if it contains oxycodone:
   - If `HAS_INGREDIENT` from the medication leads to an ingredient that matches "oxycodone," then the patient should not have a `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship with this medication.

2. **Remove the allergy relationship** if there is no actual allergy (assuming the allergy information was incorrect):
   - If oxycodone is not actually an allergen for the patient, remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship.

Assuming the first scenario where the medication contains oxycodone:
