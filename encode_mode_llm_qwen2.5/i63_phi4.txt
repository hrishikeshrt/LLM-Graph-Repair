To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that there are no relationships indicating an allergy to ingredients present in medications that a patient takes. In this case, the patient Sanford Fritsch593 has an allergy to ferrous sulfate and is taking a medication containing it.

The inconsistency arises because the patient should not be taking a medication with an ingredient they are allergic to. Therefore, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication or adjust the medication's ingredients.

Here are the suggested repairs:

1. Remove the relationship between the patient and the medication if the allergy is correct.
2. Alternatively, ensure the medication does not contain the allergen by removing the ingredient from the medication.

Given the details, let's assume the allergy information is accurate and remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication:
