The graph pattern indicates that Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension contains mestranol, which the patient is allergic to.\n\n**Suggested Repairs:**\n\n1. **Remove the Allergy Relationship**: Since the patient is taking a medication containing mestranol and has an allergy to it, this relationship should be removed to reflect accurate medical data.\n\n```xml\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [ra] | -\n</repairs>\n```\n\nThis operation ensures that the graph no longer contains the incorrect allergy information for this patient.",
