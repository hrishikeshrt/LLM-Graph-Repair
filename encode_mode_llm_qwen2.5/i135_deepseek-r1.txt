Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me read through the problem again.

We have a patient who took Humulin 70/30 from July 25 to September 26, 1965. But according to the query, it's supposed to be taken starting from November 19, 1911, which is the patient's birth date, so that makes sense. The issue seems to be with the durationâ€”only two months instead of a longer period.

Looking at the graph structure, there are relationships between Patient (p), Takes Medication (rm), Medication (m), Has Ingredient (rc), and Allergic To (ra). The medication's start and end dates are stored in rm and rc respectively. 

The problem is that the medication relationship only has a start date but no end date. So, the duration isn't fully captured. I need to add an end date property to the rm relationship.

How can I do this with the allowed operations? Well, since the end date is missing, adding it as a new edge attribute makes sense. I'll use `UPD_EDGE` to modify the existing [rm] relationship by adding the :end_date property with the value '1965-09-26'.

I don't think any other nodes or relationships need changing because the allergy seems correct, and only the medication's duration was wrong.
