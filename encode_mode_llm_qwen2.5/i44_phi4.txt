The inconsistency described involves a patient who takes a medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic. This situation poses a potential health risk and should be addressed in the graph.

To resolve this, we can consider two approaches:

1. **Remove the relationship indicating the allergy**: If it's determined that the allergy information is incorrect or outdated.
2. **Remove the relationship indicating the medication contains the allergen**: If it's determined that the ingredient information is incorrect or the patient should not be taking this medication.

Given the scenario, let's assume we need to address the risk by removing the relationship between the patient and the allergen:
