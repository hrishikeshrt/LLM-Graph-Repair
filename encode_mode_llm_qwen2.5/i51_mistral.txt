Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to update the `ALLERGIC_TO` edge's `is_error` property from 1 to 0 since it is incorrect. We also remove the existing `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship because warfarin should not be listed as an ingredient in Coumadin if Samatha has an allergy to it. Additionally, we add a new `CONTAINS` edge between the medication and its correct ingredient (warfarin) with the code 855332.
