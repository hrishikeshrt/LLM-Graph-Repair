To address the inconsistency, we need to ensure that a patient is not taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. In this case, the patient is taking "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" and is allergic to "mestranol". We must verify if "mestranol" is indeed an ingredient of "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension".

Assuming that "mestranol" is not a component of "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension", the inconsistency arises from the incorrect relationship indicating the patient's allergy to an ingredient in their medication. Therefore, we need to remove the erroneous allergic reaction edge.
