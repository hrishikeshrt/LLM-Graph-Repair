To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient's allergy aligns with their medication ingredients. The patient is allergic to oxycodone, but there is no indication that oxycodone is an ingredient in the medication they are taking (code 205923). Therefore, the relationship indicating an allergy to oxycodone should be removed.
