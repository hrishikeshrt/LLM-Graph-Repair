To address the inconsistency, we need to ensure that the patient Terrence Goodwin327 does not have an allergy to an ingredient present in a medication they are taking. Specifically, the patient is allergic to exemestane, but there is no mention of exemestane being an ingredient in HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet.

Assuming that exemestane is indeed not an ingredient in HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet, we should remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient.
