The inconsistency described involves a patient who is both taking a medication and having an allergy to one of its ingredients. Specifically, the patient has an allergy to oxycodone, which is indicated by an edge with `is_error` set to '1'. This suggests that there might be an error in how the ingredient or allergy information is recorded.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. If the allergy to oxycodone is indeed incorrect (as suggested by `is_error: '1'`), we should remove the erroneous allergy relationship.
2. Alternatively, if the medication's ingredient list incorrectly includes oxycodone, we might need to correct or remove that edge.

Assuming the primary issue lies with the allergy information being marked as an error:
