To address the inconsistency where a patient is allergic to an ingredient that is part of a medication they take, we need to remove or correct the relationship indicating the allergy. Given that the graph shows the patient is allergic to oxycodone, which is an ingredient in "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," this is likely incorrect since patients typically should not be taking medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.

The inconsistency can be resolved by removing the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient oxycodone. Here's how the repair operation would look:
