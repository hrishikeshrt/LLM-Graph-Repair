This repair suggests updating the start date of the `ra` (ALLERGIC_TO) edge and the end date of the `rc` (TAKES_MEDICATION) edge to reflect the correct timeframe for each relationship. The assumption here is that the patient did not have an allergy to epoetin alfa before October 4, 1972, and stopped taking the medication on March 19, 1977.
