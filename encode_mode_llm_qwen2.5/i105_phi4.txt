To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient with ID `3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d` is not allergic to an ingredient present in a medication they are taking. The inconsistency arises because the patient is recorded as being allergic to oxycodone, which is an ingredient in the medication they are taking.

Here's how we can resolve this:

1. **Remove the allergy relationship** between the patient and the ingredient oxycodone if it is incorrect or not relevant anymore.
