To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient is not allergic to an ingredient contained in a medication they are taking. The inconsistency arises because the patient is both taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension and is allergic to mestranol, which is an ingredient of this medication.

Here's how you can resolve the inconsistency:

1. **Remove the allergy relationship** between the patient and the ingredient mestranol if it is incorrect or not relevant anymore.

This operation assumes that the allergy information is inaccurate or needs to be updated based on current medical advice, as patients are generally advised against taking medications containing ingredients they are allergic to. If further context indicates that the allergy information should remain but with different implications (e.g., a note about managing the allergy), additional updates might be necessary. However, without such context, removing the edge is a straightforward resolution.
