To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that a patient who is allergic to an ingredient should not be taking medication containing that ingredient. In this case, the patient is allergic to "mestranol" but is taking "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which does not contain "mestranol." Therefore, there is no factual inconsistency in terms of ingredients and allergies.

However, if we assume that the description implies an error where "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" should not be associated with "mestranof" due to the allergy, then the following repair would be appropriate:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs> 

This operation removes the relationship indicating that the patient is taking the medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. If no such association should exist, this ensures compliance with the described constraint.
