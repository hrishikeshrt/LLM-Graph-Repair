The inconsistency described involves a patient who is allergic to an ingredient that is present in a medication they are taking. The logical implication of this situation is that the patient should not be taking any medication containing an allergen to which they are allergic.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to ensure that the patient does not have a relationship with the medication that contains the allergenic ingredient. Since the patient's allergy to oxycodone and their intake of a medication containing oxycodone is confirmed, the most straightforward repair would be to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication.

Here are the suggested repairs:
