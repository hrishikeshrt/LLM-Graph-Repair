To resolve the inconsistency where a patient named Sanford861 is taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic, we need to ensure that the relationship indicating the patient takes this specific medication is removed. This can be achieved by deleting the edge representing the "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship between the patient and the medication.
