Explanation: The inconsistency is that the patient is taking a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To fix this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the medicine (rm). Since the ingredient's ID is incorrect, we update the ingredient node's id property to "-" to indicate it should be removed from the graph.
