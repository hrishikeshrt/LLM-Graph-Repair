Explanation: The inconsistency is that a patient is taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To fix this, we update the allergenic properties of the problematic ingredient (epoetin alfa) to "non-allergenic" and remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient. This assumes that the allergy information is incorrect or has been resolved for some reason.
