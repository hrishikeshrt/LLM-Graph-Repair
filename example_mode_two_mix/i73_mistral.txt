Explanation: The inconsistency is that the patient (Walker122) takes a medication (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) which contains an ingredient (epoetin alfa) he is allergic to. To fix this, we update the allergenic_to and allergic_to properties of the ingredient node (epoetin alfa) to remove the patient's ID from the list of allergic patients and also delete the ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient and ingredient nodes. This repair assumes that the patient is not actually allergic to the medication itself but rather an ingredient within it, hence we do not suggest removing the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship.
