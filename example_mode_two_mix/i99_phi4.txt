To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove the relationship indicating the patient takes this specific medication. Here's how you can fix it:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | (rm) | -
</repairs>
```

This operation deletes the edge representing the "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship between the patient and the problematic medication, ensuring compliance with the requirement that a person should not be treated with medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to.
