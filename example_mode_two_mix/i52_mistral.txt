This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between `Patient` and `Medication`, updating the `Ingredient` node to indicate it is not allergenic, and adding a new relationship between the patient and the ingredient to indicate that they are no longer allergic to it. This change resolves the inconsistency while maintaining factual accuracy.
