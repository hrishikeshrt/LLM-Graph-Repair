This repair suggests that the allergy information for ingredient 'naproxen' should be updated to indicate it is not an allergen, and the relationship between the patient and the ingredient 'naproxen' should be removed. This will resolve the inconsistency where a person takes a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to.
