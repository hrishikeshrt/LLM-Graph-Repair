To resolve this, we can remove the existing relationship between the patient and the medicine (rm), and update the allergenic status of the ingredient (i) to \"non-allergen\". This assumes that there might be an error in the ingredient's allergenic status information. If it turns out that the ingredient is indeed allergic for the patient, a different approach would be required, such as finding an alternative medication without that specific ingredient.",
