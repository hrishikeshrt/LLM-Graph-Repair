This repair operation removes the relationship between the patient "Earle679" and the medication "HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet," which contains an ingredient "exemestane" to which the patient is allergic. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient is not taking a medication containing an allergen they are sensitive to.
