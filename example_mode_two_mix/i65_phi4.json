Here's how you can repair the graph:\n\n```xml\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | (rm) | -\n</repairs>\n```\n\nThis operation deletes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient \"Walker122\" and the medication containing \"epoetin alfa,\" which they are allergic to. This ensures that the patient is not treated with a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to.",
