This repair suggests removing the existing relationships between `Logan497`, the medication, and the ingredient. It also removes the incorrect association of oxycodone as an allergy for `Logan497`. Then, it adds a new ingredient (epogen) to the medication, and re-establishes the allergy relationship between `Logan497` and oxycodone.
