The second operation updates the property of the 'verapamil' ingredient to indicate it is not allergenic. This repair assumes that verapamil may not actually be an allergen for this patient. If there is no such alternative, additional repairs would need to be considered, such as finding a different medication or managing the patient's allergy.",
