This repair operation removes the relationship between the patient "Donn979" and the medication "amoxicillin (as amoxicillin trihydrate) 250 MG Oral Capsule," as it contains an ingredient to which the patient is allergic. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen.
