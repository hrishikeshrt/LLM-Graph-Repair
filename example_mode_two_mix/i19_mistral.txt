Explanation:
- Remove the existing medication and allergy relationships since Logan497 should not take oxycodone, which he is allergic to.
- Add a new allergy relationship for oxycodone with the patient node (Logan497).
- Create a placeholder medication without any description as we don't have information about an appropriate alternative medicine for this specific case.
