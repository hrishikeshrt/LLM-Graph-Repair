The first operation removes the relationship between the patient and the medication that contains the ingredient they are allergic to. The second operation updates the property of the ingredient node, marking it as not allergenic for this patient (Logan497). This change is necessary because the initial condition states that a person should not be treated with a medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, but the provided data shows otherwise. The suggested repair aims to correct this inconsistency.
