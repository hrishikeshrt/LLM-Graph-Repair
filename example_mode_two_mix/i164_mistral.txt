This repair operation suggests that the edge between the patient and the ingredient should be removed, as the patient should not be treated with a medicine containing an allergen. Then, it updates the allergy status of the ingredient by adding a new relationship (`NOT_ALLERGIC_TO`) between the patient and the ingredient. This change reflects that the patient is no longer allergic to this specific ingredient, allowing for potential future treatment with a medicine containing it.
