To fix this, we need to remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient (DEL_EDGE), and update the ingredient's information so it no longer contains the allergen (UPD_NODE). However, since we don't have any information about an alternative medication for the patient, I did not suggest adding a new medicine or relationship.",
