Explanation: The inconsistency is that a person (Walker122) takes a medicine (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) which contains an ingredient (epoetin alfa) and the same person is allergic to this ingredient. To resolve this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the medicine (DEL_EDGE), and update the property of the ingredient node (epoetin alfa) to indicate that it's not allergenic (UPD_NODE). This change assumes that there is an additional property "allergenic" on Ingredient nodes. If this property does not exist, then we would need to add it before performing the UPD_NODE operation.
