To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to ensure that this relationship does not exist. Here's how you can repair the graph:

```xml
<repairs>
    DEL_EDGE | (rm) | -
</repairs>
```

Explanation:
- `DEL_EDGE` removes the existing relationship where the patient (`p`) takes the medication (`m`). This ensures the patient is no longer associated with a medication they are allergic to. 

This operation directly addresses the inconsistency by removing the problematic medication from the patient's regimen.
