Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, a patient is taking a medication that has an ingredient they're allergic to. That's not good because it could be dangerous.

Looking at the code, we have relationships between Patient (p), Medication (m), Ingredient (i), and AllergicTo. The problem seems to be that the medicine contains an ingredient the patient is allergic to. 

Maybe the solution is to remove the relationship where the medication has the allergenic ingredient. So, I should delete the [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] relationship between m and i.

I don't see any other issues here, so just removing that edge should fix the problem.
