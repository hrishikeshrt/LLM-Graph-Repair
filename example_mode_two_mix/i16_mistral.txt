This repair suggests removing the incorrect relationship between `Logan497` and `1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection`, as well as the allergy relationship. Then, it updates the `Ingredient` node with a new unique id, since the provided id for `oxycodone` is incorrect or inconsistent. This repair assumes that there might be another ingredient in the medicine that the patient can take safely.
