Explanation: The inconsistency is that a person (Cruz300) takes a medicine (Demerol 50 MG Oral Tablet) which contains an ingredient (ferrous sulfate) that the person is allergic to. To fix this, we first remove the relationship between the patient and the medication since they should not be taking it. Then, we update the ingredient node for ferrous sulfate to indicate that it is not causing an allergy for the patient (Cruz300).
