This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between the patient and the medication, as well as updating the ingredient node to remove the incorrect ingredient information. It is important to note that the suggested repair assumes that there exists an alternative medication for the patient that does not contain the allergenic ingredient. If no such alternative can be found, additional repairs may be necessary, such as identifying and addressing the source of the inconsistency in the data.
