This repair suggests removing the inconsistent relationships and updating the ingredient id to an appropriate value that is not allergic to the patient. Since we don't know the correct ingredient for the medicine, we set its id to "-". This allows further investigation or correction of the data without causing additional inconsistencies in the graph.
