    </repairs>

This repair suggests that the edge connecting the patient to the medication should be removed, as the current medication is causing an inconsistency. Additionally, it updates the property of the oxycodone ingredient to indicate that it is not allergenic for this specific patient (Sanford861). This change assumes that there might have been a mistake in labeling the ingredient as allergenic for the patient.
