Here's how you can resolve this:\n\n1. Remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the problematic medication.\n2. Optionally, if there's another suitable medication available for the same condition, add a new relationship with that medication.\n\nAssuming no alternative medication is provided in the description, we'll focus on removing the existing relationship:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | (rm) | -\n</repairs>\n\nIf an alternative medication is known and appropriate, you could include additional operations to add this new medication. However, based on the given information, only the removal of the current problematic medication relationship is necessary.",
