   </repairs>

Explanation: The inconsistency lies in the fact that a patient is taking a medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic. To fix this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the medication (DEL_EDGE), and then update the property of the ingredient node to indicate it is not allergenic (UPD_NODE). This assumes that the error in the graph lies with the incorrect labeling of the ingredient as allergenic. If the actual medication does not contain oxycodone, a different repair would be necessary.
