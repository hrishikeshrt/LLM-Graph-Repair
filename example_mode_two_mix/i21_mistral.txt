This repair operation suggests removing the relationship between the patient and the medication, marking the ingredient as not allergic to the patient, and adding a new relationship indicating that the patient is not allergic to the ingredient. This repair assumes that there is an additional relationship type `NOT_ALLERGIC_TO` in your graph schema.
