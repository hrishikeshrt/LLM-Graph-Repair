To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication. Here's how you can repair the graph:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | (rm) | -
</repairs>
```

This operation deletes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient and the medication containing the allergen, ensuring the patient is no longer associated with this medication in the graph.
