Explanation: In this case, the inconsistency lies in the fact that a patient is allergic to an ingredient that they are taking medication containing. To fix this, we update the allergenic property of the ingredient (epoetin alfa) to false, indicating it's not an allergen for this patient. Then, we remove the relationship between the patient and the ingredient since the patient is no longer allergic to it.
