To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication containing an allergen, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this particular medication. Here's how you can repair the graph:

```xml
<repairs>
    DEL_EDGE | (rm) | -
</repairs>
```

This operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient (`p`) and the medication (`m`). This ensures that the patient is no longer associated with taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to.
