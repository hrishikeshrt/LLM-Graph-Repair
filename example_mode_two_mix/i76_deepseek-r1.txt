Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there's a patient (Walker122) who is taking Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. This medication contains Epoetin alfa, which the patient is allergic to. That's not good because the drug should not contain an allergen it's reacting to.

Looking at the graph query, there are two relationships: one from the patient (p) to the medication (m) via rm, and another from p to ingredient i via ra. Also, m has an ingredient relationship with i through rc.

The problem is that Epogen contains Epoetin alfa, which is an allergen for the patient. So, we need to remove this association between the medication and the ingredient.

First thought: Remove the edge where the medication (m) contains the allergic ingredient (i). That would mean deleting the relationship [rc]. This way, the graph won't show that Epogen has an allergen the patient is sensitive to anymore.

So, the operation should be DEL_EDGE targeting rc. I don't think we need to add or update anything else because the issue was just this one edge connecting the medication and its allergen.
