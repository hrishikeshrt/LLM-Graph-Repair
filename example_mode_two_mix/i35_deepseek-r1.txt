Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, a patient is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they're allergic to. That's not allowed because it can cause harm. The current setup has relationships showing that the medicine contains the ingredient and that the patient is allergic to it. But this leads to a conflict where the same ingredient is both in the medicine and causing an allergy.

Looking at the code, there are two relationships: rm connects p (Patient) to m (Medication), indicating the patient takes the medication. Then rc connects m to i (Ingredient), showing the medication contains the ingredient. Another relationship ra connects p to i, indicating the patient is allergic.

So, the problem is that the same ingredient is both in the medicine and causing an allergy. To fix this, we need to remove the connection between the medication and the ingredient because they can't coexist if the patient is allergic.

I think the best approach is to delete the rc relationship. That way, the graph won't show that the medicine contains the allergen anymore, resolving the inconsistency.
