To fix this, we first need to update the ingredient's id to 'ferrous sulphate' (assuming it was incorrectly entered as 'ferrous sulfate'). Then, we remove the allergy relationship between the person and the ingredient. This repair assumes that there is no other medication containing 'ferrous sulphate' that the patient is not allergic to, but if such a medication exists, additional repairs would be required.",
