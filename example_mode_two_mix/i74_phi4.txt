To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication. Here's how you can fix it:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | (rm) | -
</repairs>
```

This operation deletes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge between the patient and the medication, ensuring the patient is no longer associated with taking a medicine they are allergic to.
