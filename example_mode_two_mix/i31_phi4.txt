To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication. Here's how you can fix it:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | (rm) | -
</repairs>
```

This operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient (Logan497) and the medication containing oxycodone, ensuring that Logan497 is not treated with a medicine they are allergic to.
