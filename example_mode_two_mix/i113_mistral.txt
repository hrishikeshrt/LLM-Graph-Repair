Explanation: The given graph has an inconsistency where a patient takes a medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. To fix this, we first remove the existing relationships between the patient and the medication, and between the patient and the allergenic ingredient. Then, we add a new alternative medicine for the patient that does not contain the allergenic ingredient (oxycodone). We update the property `allergenic_for` of the oxycodone ingredient to "-" indicating it is no longer an allergen for this patient.
