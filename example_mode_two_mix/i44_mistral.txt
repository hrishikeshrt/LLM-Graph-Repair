Explanation: The inconsistency is that a patient takes a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To fix this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the medicine (rm), update the allergenic property of the ingredient (i) to 'false' to indicate it is not an allergen for the patient, which should resolve the inconsistency.
