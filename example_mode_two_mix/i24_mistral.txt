I suggest removing the relationship between the patient and the medication, updating the ingredient node to remove the allergy information for that specific patient (Logan497), and adding a new `NOT_ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient. This repair assumes that there is a `NOT_ALLERGIC_TO` relationship type in your graph model, which should be defined if it does not already exist.
