This repair suggests removing the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient "Sanford861" and the medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic. This ensures that Sanford861 is no longer treated with a medicine containing oxycodone, addressing the inconsistency in their treatment plan.
