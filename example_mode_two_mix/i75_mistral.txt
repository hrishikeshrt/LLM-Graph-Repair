This repair suggests removing the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient, and updating the ingredient's `allergenic_to` property to "-" (meaning not allergic). This change is factually accurate because the description indicates that the person should not be treated with a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to, but in this case, the allergy relationship exists. Removing it and updating the ingredient's `allergenic_to` property resolves the inconsistency.
