To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove the relationship that indicates the patient takes this specific medication. Here's how you can repair the graph:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | (rm) | -
</repairs>
```

This operation deletes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient "Walker122" and the medication containing "epoetin alfa," which they are allergic to. This ensures that the patient is not treated with a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to.
