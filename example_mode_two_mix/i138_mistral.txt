This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between the patient and the medication, as a person should not take a medicine they are allergic to. However, instead of completely removing the ingredient from the graph, we update its `allergenic_status` property to "safe". This change assumes that the inconsistency might be due to an error in labeling the ingredient as allergenic for this specific patient.
