To resolve this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the medicine (DEL_EDGE), and update the property of the ingredient node (epoetin alfa) to indicate that it's not allergenic (UPD_NODE). This change assumes that there is an additional property \"allergenic\" on Ingredient nodes. If this property does not exist, then we would need to add it before performing the UPD_NODE operation.",
