To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication containing an allergen they are allergic to, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication. Here's how you can repair it:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | (rm) | -
</repairs>
```

This operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient "Logan497" and the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection", resolving the inconsistency.
