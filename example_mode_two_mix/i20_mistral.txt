Explanation: The original graph shows a patient taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, which is inconsistent. To fix this, we remove the relationships between the patient and the problematic medicine/ingredient, add a new non-allergenic medication for the patient, and update the ingredient information to remove the incorrect association with the medicine.
