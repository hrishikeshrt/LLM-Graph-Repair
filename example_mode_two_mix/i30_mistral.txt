   </repairs>

Explanation:
The given graph shows a patient taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which the patient is allergic. To fix this inconsistency, we first remove the relationship between the patient and the medicine (rm). Then, we update the ingredient node with a different id since oxycodone seems to be incorrect for the given description of the medicine.
