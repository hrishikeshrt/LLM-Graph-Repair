To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to ensure the patient does not continue using this medication. Here's how you can resolve this:

1. Remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the problematic medication.
2. Optionally, if there's another suitable medication available for the same condition, add a new relationship with that medication.

Assuming no alternative medication is provided in the description, we'll focus on removing the existing relationship:

If an alternative medication is known and appropriate, you could include additional operations to add this new medication. However, based on the given information, only the removal of the current problematic medication relationship is necessary.
