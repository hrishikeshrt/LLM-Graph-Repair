Here are two possible repair strategies:\n\n### Strategy 1: Remove the Medication from the Patient\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | (rm) | -\n</repairs>\n\nThis operation removes the relationship indicating that Sanford861 takes the medication containing oxycodone, which they are allergic to.\n\n### Strategy 2: Replace with an Alternative Medication\n\nAssuming there is an alternative medication available that does not contain oxycodone:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | (rm) | -\nADD_NODE | (m1:Medication) | description=\"Alternative medication without oxycodone\"\nADD_EDGE | (p)-[:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m1) | -\n</repairs>\n\nThis operation removes the problematic medication and adds an alternative one that does not contain the allergen.\n\nChoose a strategy based on available alternatives or policy requirements.",
