   </repairs>

Explanation: The inconsistency is that the patient is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. To fix this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the medicine (rm), update the allergenic_substance property of the ingredient (i) to "-" (indicating it is not allergenic), which allows the patient to continue taking the medication without the inconsistency.
