This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between the patient and the medication, as the current medication is causing an inconsistency. It also updates the ingredient node to indicate that it is not allergic for the patient. This change assumes that the actual allergy status of the ingredient (verapamil) for the patient (Rosio404) is incorrect and needs to be updated.
