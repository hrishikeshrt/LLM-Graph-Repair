This repair suggests removing the existing relationships between the patient, medication, and ingredient due to the inconsistency. Then, it adds a new node for the allergenic ingredient with the correct ID. Since the patient is no longer taking the problematic medicine, we also remove the medication from their list of medications (implicitly by removing the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship).
