Here's how you can repair it:\n\n1. Remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient and the medication.\n2. Optionally, if there is another suitable medication available for the patient, add a new `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship with that alternative medication.\n\nAssuming no alternative medication is specified in the problem description, we will focus on removing the problematic relationship:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | (rm) | -\n</repairs> \n\nIf an alternative medication is identified later, you can include additional operations to add a new `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge with that medication.",
