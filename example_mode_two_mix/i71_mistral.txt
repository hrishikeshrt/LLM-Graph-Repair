Explanation: The current graph indicates that the patient Walker122 is allergic to an ingredient (epoetin alfa) which is part of a medication he takes. To fix this inconsistency, we can update the allergenic property of the ingredient epoetin alfa to false and remove the relationship between the patient and the ingredient. This change indicates that Walker122 is not actually allergic to epoetin alfa anymore or there was a mistake in the data entry.
