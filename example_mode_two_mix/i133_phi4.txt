To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to modify the graph to prevent this relationship. Here's how you can repair it:

1. Remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient and the medication.
2. Optionally, if there is another suitable medication available for the patient, add a new `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship with that alternative medication.

Assuming no alternative medication is specified in the problem description, we will focus on removing the problematic relationship:

If an alternative medication is identified later, you can include additional operations to add a new `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge with that medication.
