Explanation: The inconsistency is that the patient Walker122 is allergic to an ingredient (epoetin alfa) of a medication they are taking. To resolve this, we update the allergenic property of the ingredient epoetin alfa to false, indicating it's not actually an allergen for the patient. Then, we remove the relationship between the patient and the ingredient, as the patient is no longer allergic to that ingredient.
