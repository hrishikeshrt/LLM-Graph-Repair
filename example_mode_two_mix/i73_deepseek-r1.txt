Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, a patient is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they're allergic to. That's not good because it can cause severe reactions. The current graph shows this relationship through three relationships: TAKES_MEDICATION, HAS_INGREDIENT, and ALLERGIC_TO.

The issue here is that the same medicine (m) has two ingredients: epoetin alfa and another one. Since the patient is allergic to epoetin alfa, they shouldn't be taking this medicine at all because it contains an allergen.

So, looking at the graph structure:

- The medicine node (m) has properties like description ("1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection") and id.
- It's connected to two ingredients: one is epoetin alfa, which the patient is allergic to, and another that isn't.

The goal is to remove the part of the medicine that contains the allergen. So, I should probably split the medicine into two separate nodes: one for each ingredient. That way, we can have a new node (m1) representing the non-allergic part, and keep epoetin alfa in its own node but disconnected.

First step: Remove the existing connection between m and i because that's causing the inconsistency. So I'll delete the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship [rc].

Second step: Create a new node for the non-allergic ingredient. Let's call it m1:Medicine. This node will have the description changed to reflect the correct medication without the allergen.

Third step: Update the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship so that the patient (p) now takes this new node instead of the original medicine.

This way, we've isolated the safe part of the medicine and removed the problematic one.
