Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, a patient (Walker122) is taking Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which contains epoetin alfa. But the patient is allergic to epoetin alfa. This shouldn't be allowed because the medicine contains an allergen that the person has.

Looking at the graph query, there are two relationships: TAKES_MEDICATION from p to m, and HAS_INGREDIENT from m to i. Also, p is connected to i via ALLERGIC_TO. The problem arises because the medicine's ingredient (epoetin alfa) is linked directly to the patient through HAS_INGREDIENT.

I think we need to prevent this situation by either removing one of the relationships or modifying the data so that these two shouldn't coexist. One approach could be to remove the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship, which would stop the system from knowing that the medicine contains an allergen. Alternatively, maybe we should update the allergy information so that p isn't marked as allergic to epoetin alfa.

But since the user's example output suggests removing a relationship, I'll go with that approach. So, I'll delete the HAS_INGREDIENT edge between m and i.
