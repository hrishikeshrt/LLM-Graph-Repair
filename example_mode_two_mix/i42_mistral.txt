Explanation: The inconsistency lies in the fact that a patient is taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, we can remove the existing relationship between the patient and the medicine (rm), and update the allergenic status of the ingredient (i) to "non-allergen". This assumes that there might be an error in the ingredient's allergenic status information. If it turns out that the ingredient is indeed allergic for the patient, a different approach would be required, such as finding an alternative medication without that specific ingredient.
