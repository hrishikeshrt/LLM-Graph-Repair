Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. Node with ID 'mestranol' is labeled as an Ingredient and has the property 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'id' set to 'mestranol'.
  2. Another node, identified by the same ID, is labeled as Medication and is named 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension'. It also has a code '106892', 'tau_o' set to 1, and a description.
  3. A third node represents a Patient with the ID '3acf9313-1874-4dff-ab2a-3187516d92d6'. This patient's details include 'first name' as Earle679, 'last name' as Frami345, birthdate in 1917, deathdate in 2018, address at '208 Kilback Center Unit 20', and no recorded allergies or prescriptions before the specified time range.
  4. The medication node (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension) is connected to the ingredient node (mestranol) via an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT with a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and no errors.
  5. The patient node is associated with the medication node via an edge of type TAKES_MEDICATION, indicating that the patient took Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension between the dates '2004-12-27' and '2005-01-24'.
  6. There is also an edge connecting the patient node to the ingredient node, but it is of type ALLERGIC_TO with properties indicating no known allergies or errors.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
