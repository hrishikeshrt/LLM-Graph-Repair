Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'metformin'. It has a property 'tau_o' equal to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '860975', description '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet', and ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750'. It also has a property 'tau_o' equal to 1.

   3. There is a node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '53f3587e-b9bf-473a-b36e-62f0e1946fa1'. Its properties include 'first' and 'last' names, address, birthdate, deathdate, and tau_k.

   4. The medication node with the ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750' has an edge pointing to the ingredient node with the label 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. The edge also has a property 'tau_o' equal to 1 and 'is_error' set to '0'.

   5. The patient node has two edges pointing to the medication and ingredient nodes respectively. One edge, labeled as 'ALLERGIC_TO', has the property 'is_error' set to '1'. The other edge, labeled as 'TAKES_MEDICATION', has properties for 'start' and 'stop' dates.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
