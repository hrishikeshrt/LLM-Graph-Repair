Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'epoetin alfa'. This ingredient has a tau value of 1 and is part of the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection".

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '205923' and description "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection". This medication contains the ingredient 'epoetin alfa'.

   3. A third node represents a patient named Walker122, born on September 6, 1914, and died on March 19, 1977. The patient's address is at 524 Brekke Dale Suite 9.

   4. The patient takes the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection", starting from March 30, 1973, and continuing until an unknown date.

   5. There is an edge connecting the 'Patient' node to the 'Ingredient' node, indicating that the patient is allergic to 'epoetin alfa'. However, this edge has an error value of 1, suggesting there might be some inconsistency or uncertainty in this data.

   6. Another edge connects the 'Patient' node to the 'Medication' node, indicating that the patient takes the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection". This edge does not have an error value, suggesting that this information is accurate.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
