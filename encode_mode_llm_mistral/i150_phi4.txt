The inconsistency in this graph pattern arises from the fact that there is an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` between a patient and an ingredient, which indicates a medication error (`is_error: '1'`). This suggests that the relationship should not exist as it incorrectly associates the patient directly with an ingredient rather than through their medication.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the erroneous direct relationship between the patient and the ingredient. The correct path is for the patient to be associated with the ingredient via the medication they take.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs> 

This operation deletes the edge `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]` from the patient node to the ingredient node, thereby correcting the error in the graph structure.
