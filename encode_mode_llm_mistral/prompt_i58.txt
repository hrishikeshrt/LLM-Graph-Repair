Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         Node with ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d' is labeled as a Patient. Its properties include the first name 'Sanford861', last name 'Fritsch593', birthdate '1923-06-22', address '935 Rempel Trail', and no death date.

   Node with ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' has two labels: Ingredient and Medication. The Ingredient property is 'ferrous sulfate' with a tau_o of 1, while the Medication properties include code '860975', description '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet', and tau_o of 1.

   There is an Edge connecting the Patient node to the Ingredient node, with type HAS_INGREDIENT, key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51961, and properties indicating that the patient has the ingredient with a tau_o of 1.

   Another Edge connects the Patient node to the Medication node, with type TAKES_MEDICATION, key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:911, and properties indicating that the patient started taking the medication on '2011-04-22T09:55:43Z' and stopped on '2011-05-13T09:55:43Z'.

   There is also an Edge connecting the Patient node to another node, but its type and properties are not specified in this graph.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
