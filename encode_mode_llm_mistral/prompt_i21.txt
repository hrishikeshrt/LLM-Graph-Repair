Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   There is another node labeled as 'Medication', with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. Its ID is also 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846'. It has properties 'tau_o' set to 1.

   There is a node labeled as 'Patient', with the ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1'. This patient's first name is 'Logan497', last name is 'Brekke496', birthdate is '1913-05-30', address is '1081 Orn Street', and deathdate is '2009-05-02'. Its 'tau_o' property is set to 0.

   The node labeled as 'Ingredient' ('oxycodone') has an edge connected to the node labeled as 'Medication' (with code '205923'). This edge is of type 'HAS_INGREDIENT', and its properties include 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'is_error' set to '1'.

   The node labeled as 'Patient' also has two edges connected to the nodes labeled as 'Ingredient' ('oxycodone') and 'Medication' (with code '205923'). One edge is of type 'ALLERGIC_TO', with properties set to an empty 'tau_k', an empty 'stop' and 'start', 'is_error' set to '0'. The other edge is of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION', with properties set to 'start' and 'stop' both equal to '2007-10-12T23:35:03Z', and 'tau_o' set to 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
