Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'mestranol'. It has a property 'tau_o' with the value 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '106892' and the description 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension'. It also has a 'tau_o' property with the value 1.

   3. A third node represents a 'Patient' with the ID '3acf9313-1874-4dff-ab2a-3187516d92d6'. Its properties include 'first name' as 'Earle679', 'last name' as 'Frami345', 'birthdate' on 07th May, 1917, and 'deathdate' on 23rd January, 2018.

   4. The node representing the 'Medication' is connected to the 'Ingredient' node through an edge with the type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This edge has a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and an error flag 'is_error' set to '1'.

   5. The 'Patient' node is connected to both the 'Ingredient' and 'Medication' nodes through separate edges. One edge has the type 'ALLERGIC_TO' with properties indicating no specific start or stop dates, and an error flag 'is_error' set to '0'. The other edge has the type 'TAKES_MEDICATION', with properties indicating a start date of 22nd March, 1993 and a stop date of 12th April, 1993. The 'is_error' flag for this edge is set to '0'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
