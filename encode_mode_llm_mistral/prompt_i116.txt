Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' (Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757) with the property 'tau_o' set to 1 and an ID of 'oxycodone'.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' (Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846) with the properties 'code' set to '205923', 'description' set to '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', and 'tau_o' set to 1.

   3. There is a third node labeled as 'Patient' (Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840) with properties including an address at '935 Rempel Trail', a birthdate of '1923-06-22', an empty 'tau_k' list, first name 'Sanford861', last name 'Fritsch593', an empty 'deathdate', and an ID of '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'.

   4. The medication node is connected to the ingredient node through an edge with a key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036, type_ 'HAS_INGREDIENT', and properties with 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'is_error' set to '1'.

   5. The patient node is connected to the ingredient node through an edge with a key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:985, type_ 'ALLERGIC_TO', and properties with empty 'start' and 'stop', 'tau_o' set to 0, and 'is_error' set to '0'.

   6. The patient node is also connected to the medication node through an edge with a key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:145, type_ 'TAKES_MEDICATION', and properties with 'stop' set to '2015-07-02T09:55:43Z', an empty 'start', 'tau_o' set to 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
