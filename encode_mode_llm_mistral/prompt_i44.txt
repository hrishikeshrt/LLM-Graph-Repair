OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
