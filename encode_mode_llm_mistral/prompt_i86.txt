Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'epoetin alfa'. It has a property 'tau_o' with value 1.

   2. The same node is also labeled as 'Medication', with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. It too has a property 'tau_o' with value 1.

   3. There is another node labeled as 'Patient' with ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b'. Its properties include 'first name' (Walker122), 'last name' (Kuhic920), 'address' at '524 Brekke Dale Suite 9', 'birthdate' on 1914-09-06, and 'deathdate' on 1977-03-19.

   4. The 'Ingredient' node (epoetin alfa) has an edge connected to the 'Medication' node with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52035, type_ HAS_INGREDIENT, and properties with 'tau_o' as 1 and 'is_error' as 0.

   5. The same 'Patient' node has an edge connected to the 'Ingredient' node (epoetin alfa) with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:981, type_ ALLERGIC_TO, and properties with 'is_error' as 1.

   6. The same 'Patient' node also has an edge connected to the 'Medication' node (epoetin alfa) with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51, type_ TAKES_MEDICATION, and properties with 'start' on 1967-08-23T09:30:42Z and 'stop' as an empty string.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
