Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me go through each point step by step.

First, there's an Ingredient node called 'oxycodone' with a property 'tau_o' set to 1. Then, there's a Medication node with code '205923' that also has 'tau_o' as 1. The Patient is connected to both through edges: one via ALLERGIC_TO and another via TAKES_MEDICATION.

Looking at the details, the edge between the Patient and the Ingredient (ALLERGIC_TO) has 'tau_o' set to 0. But wait, the error flag says it's not an error because 'is_error' is '0'. Similarly, the TAKES MEDICATION edge also has 'tau_o' as 0 with no errors.

Hmm, but the Ingredient node itself has a 'tau_o' of 1. That might be conflicting because if the ALLERGIC_TO edge isn't an error (so it's correct), maybe the 'tau_o' shouldn't be set there. Also, the medication node having 'tau_o' as 1 could indicate some issue.

So perhaps the 'tau_o' properties on these edges are incorrect. They should both have 'tau_o' set to 0 because they're not errors according to their error flags.
