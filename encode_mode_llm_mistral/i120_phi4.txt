The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the fact that an `Ingredient` node labeled 'oxycodone' has a property `tau_o` set to 1, indicating a potential error. This is further supported by the edge of type `HAS_INGREDIENT` connecting this ingredient to a medication, which also has `tau_o` set to 1 and `is_error` set to '1'. Additionally, there's an allergy relationship (`ALLERGIC_TO`) between the patient and the same ingredient with conflicting properties: `tau_o` is 0 (indicating no error) but lacks explicit property specifications.

To resolve these inconsistencies:

1. The `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge should be removed as it likely represents a data entry error, given its `is_error` status.
2. The `Ingredient` node labeled 'oxycodone' with `tau_o` set to 1 should have this property corrected if the ingredient is indeed valid and not erroneous.

Here are the suggested repairs:
