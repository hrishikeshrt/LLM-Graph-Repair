To address the inconsistency, we need to ensure that the patient's allergy and medication intake are accurately represented. The issue arises because the patient is allergic to an ingredient (oxycodone) present in a medication they take. This situation should be avoided or clarified.

1. Remove the relationship indicating the patient is taking the medication containing oxycodone, as it contradicts their allergy.
2. Optionally, if the patient should not be allergic to oxycodone, remove the allergy relationship instead.

Assuming the primary concern is the contradiction in taking a medication they are allergic to:
