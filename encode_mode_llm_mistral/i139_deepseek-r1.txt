Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix these inconsistencies in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

First, there are two nodes that have conflicting labels and properties: 'a708bca4-8fc9-4567-8c22-8b13d44f4f45' is labeled as a Patient but doesn't have a death date. Then, 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' is both an Ingredient and a Medication. It has naproxen as an ingredient and verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet as a medication, which doesn't make sense because one can't be both.

Looking at the edges: there's an edge from Patient to Ingredient with type HAS_INGREDIENT, tau_o=1, and error flag '1'. This suggests the patient has naproxen. Another edge connects Patient to Medication with TAKES_MEDICATION, indicating they started on 2001-07-20 and stopped on 2001-08-24.

The problem is that the same node is both an Ingredient and a Medication, which should be separate. So I need to split this into two nodes: one for Naproxen as an ingredient and another for Verapamil as a medication. That way, each label is correct without conflict.

So, I'll add a new node for Verapamil with its details. Then, remove the existing edge between Patient and the merged node because now it should be connected to both Naproxen (as an ingredient) and Verapamil (as a medication). Finally, update the edges so that the Patient is connected correctly to both new nodes.

This way, all labels are accurate, and there's no duplication. I think this approach addresses the inconsistency by separating the conflicting node into two distinct ones.
