Explanation of Repairs:
1. `UPD_NODE` operation is used to remove the incorrect label 'Ingredient' from the node with ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1', ensuring it only has the 'Patient' label.
2. `DEL_EDGE` operation removes the erroneous relationship `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]` between the Patient and Ingredient nodes, as a patient cannot have an ingredient directly.
