Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         Node with ID 'a708bca4-8fc9-4567-8c22-8b13d44f4f45' is labeled as a Patient. The patient's first name is Weldon459, last name is Effertz744, birthdate is 1944-04-14, address is '356 Kuhn Grove Suite 62', and has no known death date.

   Node with ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' is labeled as both an Ingredient and a Medication. The ingredient has the unique identifier 'naproxen', while the medication is identified by the code '897718' and described as 'verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet'.

   There is an edge connecting the Patient node to the Ingredient node, with type HAS_INGREDIENT. The edge has a property 'tau_o' of 1 and an error flag set to '1'. This suggests that the patient has the ingredient naproxen at some point in time.

   There is another edge connecting the Patient node to the Medication node, with type TAKES_MEDICATION. The edge properties indicate that the patient started taking this medication on 2001-07-20 and stopped on 2001-08-24.

   Lastly, there is an edge connecting the Patient node to the Ingredient node with type ALLERGIC_TO. The edge properties do not indicate any specific start or stop dates for this allergy, suggesting it may be a persistent allergy.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
