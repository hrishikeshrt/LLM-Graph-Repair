The inconsistency described involves a patient who is allergic to an ingredient ('mestranol') that is part of a medication ('Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension') they are taking. This situation suggests a potential data entry error or oversight, as it would be unusual for a patient to take a medication containing an allergen without adverse effects.

To address this inconsistency, the following repairs are suggested:

1. **Remove the erroneous relationship between the ingredient and the medication**: The edge `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]` connecting 'mestranol' (Ingredient) to 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension' (Medication) should be deleted because it is likely incorrect for a patient with an allergy to that ingredient.

2. **Remove the erroneous relationship between the patient and the medication**: The edge `[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]` connecting the patient to the medication should also be removed, as it is inconsistent with the patient's known allergy.
