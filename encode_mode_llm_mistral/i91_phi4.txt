The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves a node labeled as an Ingredient (`mestranol`) having a property `tau_o` set to 1, which suggests that it should be considered valid. However, this same ingredient is connected via a relationship of type `HAS_INGREDIENT` with a property `is_error` set to '1', indicating an error in the data.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to address the erroneous edge between the Medication and Ingredient nodes. The presence of `is_error: 1` suggests that the relationship should not exist or needs correction.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs> 

This operation removes the erroneous edge, resolving the inconsistency between the node properties and the relationship error flag.
