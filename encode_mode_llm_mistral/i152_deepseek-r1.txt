Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are a couple of issues:

1. **Medication Allergy Conflict**: The patient Teddy976 has an allergy to 'metformin', but according to the data, he is taking it both before and after the allergy period. This seems contradictory because if he has an allergy, he shouldn't be taking that medication.

2. **Redundant Information**: The same medication has two different labels: one as '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet' and another as 'Ingredient' with ID 'metformin'. This duplication might cause confusion or errors in the system.

First, I'll tackle the allergy issue. Since Teddy976 is taking metformin both before and after his allergy period, which doesn't make sense logically, it's likely an error. So, removing the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between the medication and metformin would fix this inconsistency because having an allergy to metformin shouldn't mean he's taking it.

Next, for the redundant label information, I notice that the medication has both a 'medication' type relationship (rm) and an 'ingredient' relationship (rc). Having two separate relationships with the same code might be causing issues. Merging these into one relationship would streamline the data and eliminate redundancy.

So, to fix this, I'll:

- Remove the HAS_INGREDIENT edge between the medication and metformin.
- Update the medication node so that it only has a single type of 'medication' instead of both 'rm' and 'rc'.

This should resolve both inconsistencies without causing any data loss or confusion in the graph.
