Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'.
  2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '205923' and the description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'.
  3. A third node represents a patient, identified by '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d', with the first name 'Sanford861' and the last name 'Fritsch593'. The patient's birthdate is recorded as '1923-06-22', and no death date has been provided.
  4. The medication node (with code '205923') has an ingredient, which is 'oxycodone'. This relationship is represented by the edge with type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'.
  5. The patient node is associated with the 'Ingredient' node through an edge of type 'ALLERGIC_TO', indicating that the patient is allergic to oxycodone.
  6. Additionally, the patient takes the medication (with code '205923') as per the edge of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. The start and stop dates for this relationship are both '2016-01-19T09:55:43Z'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
