Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'mestranol'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', named 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension'. Its code is '106892'. It also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and a description.

   3. Additionally, there is a node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '137acc1b-dbca-473e-84bb-fe1baaf98819'. Its properties include first name 'Boyd', last name 'Beahan375', birthdate, address, deathdate, and tau_k which is an empty list.

   4. The node labeled as 'Medication' (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension) has an edge connected to the node labeled as 'Ingredient' (mestranol), with a key, type_, and properties.

   5. Similarly, the node labeled as 'Patient' (Boyd Beahan375) has edges connected to both the nodes labeled as 'Medication' (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension) and 'Ingredient' (mestranol). These edges have keys, types_, and properties as well.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
