Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'exemestane'. This ingredient has a tau value of 1.

   2. Adjacent to it, there is another node labeled as 'Medication', having the code '310798' and description 'HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet'. This medication also has a tau value of 1.

   3. There is yet another node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '953f1037-d691-4543-9a24-85baa47c9902'. This patient has properties such as first name 'Terrence276', last name 'Goodwin327', birthdate '1955-03-23', address '538 Lockman Mission Apt 66', and deathdate as an empty string. The tau value of this patient is 0.

   4. The ingredient node with the label 'Ingredient' and ID 'exemestane' has an edge connected to it from the medication node with code '310798'. This edge is of type HAS_INGREDIENT, and its properties include a tau value of 1 and an error status of '1'.

   5. The patient node also has two edges connecting to both the ingredient and medication nodes. One edge of type ALLERGIC_TO between the patient and the medication node has no start or stop dates, a tau value of 0, and an error status of '0'. Another edge of type TAKES_MEDICATION connects the patient to the medication node. This edge has start date '2003-11-05T10:25:45Z', stop date '2004-11-10T10:25:45Z', a tau value of 0, and an error status of '0'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
