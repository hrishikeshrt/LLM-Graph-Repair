Explanation:
1. Update the 'oxycodone' ingredient node with a more accurate description.
2. Add a `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the correct medication and 'oxycodone' ingredient nodes, specifying the quantity as 1 (since it is not provided).
3. Update the description of the medication node to include the new ingredient information.
4. Remove the allergy edge from the patient to the ingredient 'oxycodone'.
5. Add a `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient and the correct medication node, specifying the start date as March 7, 2003, and an end date of "present".
