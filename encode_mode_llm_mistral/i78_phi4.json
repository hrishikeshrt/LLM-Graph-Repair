This scenario suggests either an error in recording the allergy or the medication-taking relationship.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we will remove the erroneous ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient and the medication. The TAKES_MEDICATION relationship should remain intact as it is more likely that the allergy information was recorded incorrectly.\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [ra] | -\n</repairs>",
