Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'epoetin alfa'. It has a property 'tau_o' with value 1.
   There is another node labeled as 'Medication', with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. It also has a property 'tau_o' with value 1.
   A third node represents a patient with ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b'. The patient's first name is 'Walker122', last name is 'Kuhic920', birthdate is '1914-09-06', and deathdate is '1977-03-19'.
   The node representing the medication has an edge connected to the patient node, with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:894 and type_ 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. The properties include a start date of '1975-06-18T09:30:42Z' and an end date of '1975-06-18T09:30:42Z'.
   There is also an edge connecting the patient node to the ingredient node, with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52035 and type_ 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. The properties indicate that the ingredient is not an error.
   Lastly, there is another edge connecting the patient node to the medication node with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:981 and type_ 'ALLERGIC_TO'. The properties suggest that there is an error in the data.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
