Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        RETURN *
        1. Node with ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1' is labeled as a Patient, named Logan497, born on 1913-05-30 and died on 2009-05-02. The address of this patient is '1081 Orn Street'.

   2. Another node with ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' is labeled as both Medication and Ingredient. The medication, identified by the code '205923', is 1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. As an ingredient, it has a tau_o value of 1 and an id 'oxycodone'.

   3. The same node (ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93') is also connected to the patient node (ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1'). The connection is of type TAKES_MEDICATION, starting on 2004-06-26T23:35:03Z and without any specified stop date.

   4. There is also an ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient (ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1') and the Ingredient/Medication node (ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93'). This relationship does not have any specified start or stop dates.

   5. Lastly, there is an HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between the Medication/Ingredient node (ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93') and the Ingredient node (ID 'oxycodone'). This relationship has a tau_o value of 1 and an is_error value of '1'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
