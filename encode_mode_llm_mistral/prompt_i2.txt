Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'exemestane' and property values 'tau_o': 1. This ingredient is also associated with the medication code '310798'.

   2. Another node labeled as 'Medication' exists, identified by the ID 'HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet', which has properties such as 'code': '310798', 'description': 'HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet', and 'tau_o': 1.

   3. A third node is present, labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '3acf9313-1874-4dff-ab2a-3187516d92d6'. This patient's properties include 'first': 'Earle679', 'last': 'Frami345', 'birthdate': '1917-05-07', 'deathdate': '2018-01-23', and 'address': '208 Kilback Center Unit 20'.

   4. The 'Ingredient' node with the ID 'exemestane' is connected to the 'Medication' node via an edge of type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This connection has a property 'tau_o': 1 and 'is_error': '1'.

   5. The 'Patient' node is linked to both the 'Medication' and 'Ingredient' nodes through edges. One edge, of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION', indicates that this patient started taking the medication on '1958-11-10T13:57:11Z' and stopped on '1959-11-16T13:57:11Z'. The other edge, of type 'ALLERGIC_TO', does not have any specific start or stop dates.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
