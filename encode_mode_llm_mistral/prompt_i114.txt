Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There exists a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'.
  2. There also exists a node labeled as 'Medication', having the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'.
  3. Another node is present, labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. This patient goes by the name Sanford861 and lives at 935 Rempel Trail.
  4. The medication node has an edge connecting to the ingredient node, with the key '5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036' and type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'.
  5. The patient node has an edge connecting to the ingredient node, with the key '5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:985' and type 'ALLERGIC_TO'.
  6. The patient node also has an edge connecting to the medication node, with the key '5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:703' and type 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. The start date for this edge is '2014-04-17T09:55:43Z', and the stop date, if applicable, is empty.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
