Explanation of Repairs:
1. **Add a new Ingredient node**: The graph indicates that the patient is allergic to an ingredient, but no specific allergen is specified in the graph. Therefore, we need to create a node for the ingredient 'ferrous sulfate' if it doesn't already exist.
2. **Create an ALLERGIC_TO relationship**: Establish a relationship between the patient and the ingredient they are allergic to by adding an edge of type `ALLERGIC_TO`.
3. **Ensure Ingredient properties are correct**: Update or ensure that the ingredient node has the correct property 'tau_o': 1, as specified in the description.
