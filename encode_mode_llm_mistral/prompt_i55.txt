Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'warfarin'. Its property 'tau_o' has a value of 1.
  2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', identified by the code '855332' and described as 'Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet'. This node also has a 'tau_o' property with a value of 1.
  3. A third node represents a 'Patient' named Samatha845, born on February 14, 1941, and living at 531 Collier Wynd. This node does not have any initial or final death date, and its 'tau_o' property is 0.
  4. The medication node (Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet) has an edge connecting to the ingredient node (warfarin). This connection indicates that the medication contains warfarin as an ingredient.
  5. There is an edge between the patient node and the medication node, indicating that Samatha845 takes Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet. The start date of this medication is July 3, 1998, and it was stopped on July 31, 1998.
  6. Additionally, there is an edge between the patient node and the patient herself, indicating that Samatha845 has an allergy or adverse reaction to herself (possibly a typo).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
