Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'amoxicillin'. Its property 'tau_o' is 1 and it has the ID 'amoxicillin'.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the ID '308182'. It has a description of 'amoxicillin (as amoxicillin trihydrate) 250 MG Oral Capsule', a code '308182', and a property 'tau_o' of 1.

   3. There is a node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '8d236c5c-485e-4030-b3e8-20e580afbb0a'. Its properties include an address at '330 Hermiston Trafficway', birthdate on '2010-03-11', and various empty lists for 'tau_k', 'last', and 'first'.

   4. The node with ID 'amoxicillin' has an edge connected to the node labeled as 'Medication' with the key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51889. This edge is of type HAS_INGREDIENT and has a property 'tau_o' of 1 and an 'is_error' value of '0'.

   5. The node with ID 'Patient' has two edges connected to the nodes labeled as 'Ingredient' and 'Medication'. One edge, with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:968, is of type ALLERGIC_TO and has an empty property list and 'is_error' value of '1'. The other edge, with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52063, is of type TAKES_MEDICATION and has properties for 'start' and 'stop'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
