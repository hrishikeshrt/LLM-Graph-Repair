Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'mestranol'. It has a property 'tau_o' with value 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', whose code is '106892' and description is 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension'. This node also has a property 'tau_o' with value 1.

   3. A third node represents a 'Patient' identified by the ID 'b656a85d-637d-458a-abd8-17219816280f'. This patient was born on January 13, 1974, and lives at '817 Schinner Pathway'.

   4. The 'Ingredient' node with ID 'mestranol' has an edge connected to the 'Medication' node, indicating that it 'HAS_INGREDIENT' in the medication. This edge also has a property 'tau_o' with value 1 and 'is_error' as '1'.

   5. The patient node is connected to the 'Ingredient' node through an edge labeled as 'ALLERGIC_TO', indicating that the patient is allergic to this ingredient. This edge has no properties.

   6. Additionally, the patient node is also connected to the 'Medication' node via an edge labeled as 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. The start and stop dates for this medication are provided: the patient started taking this medication on March 29, 2009, and stopped on May 3, 2009. This edge also has no properties.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
