Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         Node with ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b' (Patient) has the first name "Walker122" and last name "Kuhic920". This patient was born on 6th September, 1914 and died on 19th March, 1977.

   Node with ID 'epoetin alfa' (Ingredient) has the property 'id' set to 'epoetin alfa'.

   Node with ID '205923' (Medication) has a description "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection", code '205923', and 'id' property set to the same value.

   The Ingredient node is related to the Medication node through an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT with a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and no errors.

   The Patient node has an edge of type TAKES_MEDICATION connected to the Medication node, indicating that this patient takes the medication. The properties of this edge include start and stop dates, both set to '1970-06-26T09:30:42Z'.

   There is also an edge of type ALLERGIC_TO connecting the Patient node to another unspecified node, with a property 'is_error' set to '1', suggesting that there might be some error or inconsistency in this data. The start and stop dates for this allergy are not specified.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
