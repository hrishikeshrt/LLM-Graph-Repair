Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'epoetin alfa'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. It also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   3. A third node represents a patient named Walker122, born on September 6, 1914, and died on March 19, 1977. This node is labeled as 'Patient', and it has properties such as address, birthdate, deathdate, id, and first and last names.

   4. The node representing the medication (205923) has an edge connected to the ingredient node ('epoetin alfa') through a HAS_INGREDIENT relationship. This edge also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'is_error' set to '0'.

   5. The patient node (Walker122) has two edges connected to the medication node (205923). One of these edges represents that Walker122 is allergic to this medication, as indicated by the ALLERGIC_TO relationship type and 'is_error' set to '1'.

   6. The other edge connecting the patient node to the medication node indicates that Walker122 takes this medication. This relationship is represented by the TAKES_MEDICATION type, with properties including start and stop dates. In this case, the medication was started on June 9, 1971, but there is no recorded end date ('stop' is empty).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
