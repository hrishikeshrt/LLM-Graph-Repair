The inconsistency arises from the fact that there are two nodes with the same ID 'oxycodone', one labeled as 'Ingredient' and another as 'Medication'. This can lead to confusion in relationships, especially since both have a property `tau_o` with a value of 1. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure each node has a unique identifier.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | i | { id: "ingredient_oxycodone" }
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | m | { id: "medication_205923" }
</repairs>

These operations rename the IDs of the 'Ingredient' and 'Medication' nodes to ensure they are unique, thus resolving the inconsistency.
