   Explanation: The ingredient 'ferrous sulfate' is not associated with the medication '860975'. To fix this, we remove the existing HAS_INGREDIENT edge and add a new one to the correct Ingredient node. We also update the tau_o property of the ALLERGIC_TO edge for the patient since they are allergic to the ingredient 'ferrous sulfate'. To maintain consistency, we set the tau_o property of the new HAS_INGREDIENT edge to 2 instead of 1 (as it was originally for the incorrect edge).
