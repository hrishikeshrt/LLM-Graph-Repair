Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me read through the problem again.

So, there are two nodes labeled 'Medication' and 'Ingredient' with the same ID 'epoetin alfa'. The Medication node has a 'tau_o' of 1, while the Ingredient node also has 'tau_o' set to 1 but no other properties. Then, there's a Patient node that connects to both these nodes via different edges: TAKES_MEDICATION and ALLERGIC_TO.

The issue seems to be that the same ingredient is being represented as both a medication and an ingredient in the graph. This duplication might cause confusion or incorrect data associations.

I need to decide which node to keep. Since 'epoetin alfa' is commonly known as a medication, maybe it's better to have the Medication node take ownership of this ID. So, I should delete the Ingredient node that has the same ID but different properties.

Next, any edges connected to the now-deleted Ingredient node should also be removed because they reference 'epoetin alfa' incorrectly as an ingredient. That means deleting both the HAS_INGREDIENT and ALLERGIC_TO edges linked to this node.

So, I'll perform two delete operations: one for the Ingredient node and another for each of its related edges.
