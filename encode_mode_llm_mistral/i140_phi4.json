This situation suggests either an error in the allergy data or the need for further clarification, such as distinguishing between different types of allergies (e.g., non-severe vs. severe).\n\nTo resolve this, we can consider removing the edge indicating the allergy if it is determined to be incorrect based on additional context not provided here. Alternatively, if the allergy information is correct but needs to be flagged differently, an update might be necessary.\n\nAssuming the allergy data is incorrect:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [ra] | -\n</repairs>",
