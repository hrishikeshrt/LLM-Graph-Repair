The inconsistency in the graph arises from the patient being both allergic to and taking a medication that contains an allergenic ingredient. This situation suggests an error in either the medication's composition or the allergy record.

To resolve this, we should address the erroneous relationship between the `Medication` and its `Ingredient`, as indicated by the `is_error` property set to '1'. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patient is not taking a medication they are allergic to. Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rm] | {start: null, stop: null}
</repairs> 

These operations remove the erroneous `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship and update the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship to reflect that the patient should not be taking this medication.
