Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'epoetin alfa'.
  2. The same node is also labeled as 'Medication', and it has the code '205923' and the description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'.
  3. There is another node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b'. This patient's first name is 'Walker122', last name is 'Kuhic920', birthdate is '1914-09-06', and death date is '1977-03-19'.
  4. The ingredient node with the ID 'epoetin alfa' has a relationship with the patient node through an edge labeled as 'HAS_INGREDIENT'.
  5. The patient node also has a relationship with the ingredient node, but this time it is labeled as 'ALLERGIC_TO', indicating that the patient is allergic to this ingredient.
  6. Additionally, there is another relationship between the patient and the medication node (not the same as the ingredient), which is labeled as 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. This indicates that the patient started taking this medication on '1970-05-30T09:30:42Z' and possibly stopped at some point.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
