Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         Node with ID 'b5581477-7033-4586-bc95-da6a508bdab6' is labeled as a Patient. This patient, named Rosio404, was born on 1914-09-05 and died on 2000-09-05.
   Node with ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' is labeled as a Medication. It has the code '897718' and is described as 'verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet'.
   Node with ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' is labeled as an Ingredient. Its only label is 'Ingredient', and it has the property 'id' set to 'verapamil'.
   The Medication node is related to the Ingredient node through an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT with a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and no error.
   The Patient node is related to both the Medication and Ingredient nodes. It has an edge of type TAKES_MEDICATION with properties indicating that the patient started taking this medication on 1985-08-24 and stopped on 1986-08-30. There is also an edge of type ALLERGIC_TO between the Patient and Medication nodes, but this edge has an error ('is_error' set to '1').

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
