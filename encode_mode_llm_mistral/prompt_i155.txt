Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'ferrous sulfate'.
  2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '860975' and description '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet'.
  3. A third node represents a patient with ID 'cecb7ece-fb70-4a7f-b51d-6e8dd1506ad9', having properties such as first name 'Isiah14', last name 'Fritsch593', birthdate '1951-01-06', address '690 Stark Vista', and no death date.
  4. The ingredient node is connected to the medication node via an edge with type 'HAS_INGREDIENT' and property 'ferrous sulfate'.
  5. The patient node is connected to both the ingredient and medication nodes. The connection to the ingredient node has type 'ALLERGIC_TO' and no properties, indicating that the patient is allergic to the ingredient 'ferrous sulfate'.
  6. The connection to the medication node has type 'TAKES_MEDICATION', with properties indicating that the patient started taking this medication on '2007-04-07T06:11:10Z' and stopped on '2007-04-28T06:11:10Z'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
