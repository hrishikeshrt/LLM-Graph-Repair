To fix this, we can first update the existing 'Ingredient' node with the correct code 'metformin'. Then, we add a new ingredient node and connect it to the 'Medication' node through a 'HAS_INGREDIENT' relationship. Next, we update the 'ALLERGIC_TO' edge to point to the newly created ingredient node instead of the original one. Finally, we remove the direct allergy edge between the patient and the ingredient.",
