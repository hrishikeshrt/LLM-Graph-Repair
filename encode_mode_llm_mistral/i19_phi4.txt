The inconsistency arises from a single node being labeled both as `Medication` and `Ingredient`, which should not be the case. Additionally, there are relationships that imply this dual role, such as `TAKES_MEDICATION` and `ALLERGIC_TO` with an ingredient, and `HAS_INGREDIENT` connecting to itself.

To resolve these inconsistencies:

1. Separate the node into two distinct nodes: one for `Medication` and another for `Ingredient`.
2. Adjust relationships accordingly:
   - Remove the incorrect `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship from the Ingredient node.
   - Add a new `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the Medication and Ingredient nodes.
