Here's the reasoning behind these suggested repairs:

1. The ingredient 'ferrous sulfate' and the medication with code '860975' both have a property 'tau_o': 1, which is inconsistent as they should not share this property. Therefore, we remove the 'tau_o' property from both nodes.
2. The patient 'cecb7ece-fb70-4a7f-b51d-6e8dd1506ad9' has no specified allergen in the graph, so we add a new edge (`ALLERGIC_TO`) to connect this patient with an unspecified allergen node.
3. Since there is no explicit information about the allergen, we don't provide any details for the `UPD_EDGE` operation. The new allergen node will be created without any properties.
