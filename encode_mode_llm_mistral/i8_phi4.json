  "content": "The inconsistency arises from having two nodes with the same ID 'oxycodone', one labeled as 'Ingredient' and the other as 'Medication'. This can lead to confusion in relationships involving these nodes. To resolve this, we need to ensure that each node has a unique identifier.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nUPD_NODE | i | {id: 'oxycodone_ingredient'}\n</repairs>\n\n<repairs>\nUPD_NODE | m | {id: '205923_medication'}\n</repairs>\n\nThese updates ensure that each node has a unique identifier, preventing any ambiguity in the relationships.",
