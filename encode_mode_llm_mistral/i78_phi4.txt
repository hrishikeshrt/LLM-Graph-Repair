The inconsistency arises from the fact that a patient, Walker122, has an allergy to a medication they are also taking. This scenario suggests either an error in recording the allergy or the medication-taking relationship.

To resolve this issue, we will remove the erroneous ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient and the medication. The TAKES_MEDICATION relationship should remain intact as it is more likely that the allergy information was recorded incorrectly.
