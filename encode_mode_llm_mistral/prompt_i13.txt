Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1. A node labeled as 'Medication' with the ID '205923' also exists, and it has a description of '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', a code '205923', and a property 'tau_o' set to 1. Another node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1' exists, which has properties like 'address', 'birthdate', 'first', 'last', 'deathdate', and 'tau_o'.

   The nodes 'Ingredient', 'Medication', and 'Patient' are connected through edges. One edge connects the 'Ingredient' node to the 'Medication' node, indicating that the medication has 'oxycodone' as an ingredient. Another edge connects the 'Patient' node to the 'Ingredient' node, suggesting that the patient is allergic to oxycodone. The last edge connects the 'Patient' node to the 'Medication' node, implying that the patient takes the medication starting from a certain date and possibly ending on another date.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
