Okay, so I'm trying to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me see what's going on here.

First, there are two nodes with tau_o set to 1: one is an Ingredient (mestranol) and another is a Medication (106892). That seems odd because each node type should probably have unique identifiers or properties that distinguish them. Maybe it's causing some confusion or duplication issues.

Looking at the edges, the medication has a 'tau_o' of 0, which makes sense since it's an entity with its own properties. The ingredient and patient both have tau_o as 1. I'm not sure why all these nodes share this property, but maybe that's intentional for some reason.

The main problem seems to be having two nodes with the same tau_o value. Since they are different types (one is a medication, one is an ingredient), it might not cause issues directly, but perhaps there's another inconsistency elsewhere.

Wait, the patient has both 'ALLERGIC_TO' and 'TAKES_MEDICATION' edges to the ingredient and medication respectively. That could be okay if they're separate relationships. But I'm also noticing that the 'tau_o' for the patient is 1 in all cases except maybe another edge.

Hmm, perhaps the issue isn't with these nodes directly but how their tau_o properties are handled across different relationships. Maybe each relationship should have its own tau_o value or something like that.

I think the best approach here is to remove the tau_o property from both the ingredient and medication nodes since they already have unique identifiers (the medication code). This way, there won't be any duplication issues, and it might prevent conflicts in queries that rely on tau_o for filtering.
