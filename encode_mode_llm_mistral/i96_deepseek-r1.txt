Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are two nodes that are both labeled as Ingredients: 'mestranol' and 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension'. Wait, but 'Humulin' sounds like a medication, right? So maybe this is an error where a medication was incorrectly labeled as an ingredient. 

Looking at the edges, 'mestranol' has an edge to 'rc: HAS_INGREDIENT', which seems correct because it's an ingredient in Humulin. But then there's another edge from 'Humulin' to 'i: Ingredient' with type ALLERGIC_TO. That doesn't make sense because medications aren't typically allergics; that should be patients or ingredients.

So the problem is that 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension' is both a medication and an ingredient, which isn't correct. The solution would be to remove it from being an ingredient so it can properly be labeled as a medication instead.
