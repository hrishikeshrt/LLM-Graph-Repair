Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'. Its property 'tau_o' is set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. Its properties include 'tau_o' set to 1.

   3. There is a node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1'. Its properties include 'first name' as 'Logan497', 'last name' as 'Brekke496', 'address' as '1081 Orn Street', 'birthdate' as '1913-05-30', 'deathdate' as '2009-05-02', and 'tau_o' set to 0.

   4. The medication node with the code '205923' has an ingredient, which is 'oxycodone'. This relationship is represented by an edge with type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'.

   5. The patient node has an allergy to something, but the details are not provided. This is represented by another edge with type 'ALLERGIC_TO'.

   6. The patient also takes the medication with code '205923', starting from and ending on '2004-05-03T23:35:03Z'. This relationship is represented by another edge with type 'TAKES_MEDICATION'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
