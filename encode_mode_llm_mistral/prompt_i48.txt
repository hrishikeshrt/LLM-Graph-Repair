Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         There are three nodes in this graph. The first node is labeled as 'Patient' and its properties include the patient's name (Terrence276) and last name (Goodwin327), birthdate (1955-03-23), address (538 Lockman Mission Apt 66), and a tau value of 0.

   The second node is labeled as 'Medication' and its properties include the medication code (310798), description ('HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet'), and tau value of 1.

   The third node is labeled as 'Ingredient' and its properties include the item id ('exemestane') and a tau value of 1.

   There are also three edges connecting these nodes. The first edge connects the 'Patient' and 'Medication' nodes, with the type being 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. The properties indicate that Terrence Goodwin started taking this medication on 1980-06-25 and stopped on 1981-07-01.

   The second edge connects the 'Patient' node to the 'Ingredient' node, with the type being 'ALLERGIC_TO'. There are no specific start or stop dates provided for this allergy.

   The third edge also connects the 'Patient' and 'Ingredient' nodes, but with the type being 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This edge indicates that Terrence Goodwin has exemestane as an ingredient in the medication he is taking.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
