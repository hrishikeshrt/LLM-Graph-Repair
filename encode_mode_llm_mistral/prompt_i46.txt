Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'verapamil'. It also has the property 'tau_o' set to 1 and an additional property 'id' set to 'verapamil'.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication'. Its ID is '897718', it has a description of 'verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet', 'tau_o' set to 1, and the property 'code' also set to '897718'.

   3. There is a node labeled as 'Patient' with ID 'b5581477-7033-4586-bc95-da6a508bdab6'. This node has properties such as 'first name' set to 'Rosio404', 'last name' set to 'Bayer639', 'address' set to '856 Carroll Center Apt 22', 'birthdate' set to '1914-09-05', and 'deathdate' set to '2000-09-05'.

   4. The node with ID 'verapamil' has an edge connected to the 'Medication' node, which indicates that 'verapamil' is an ingredient of this medication (type_: HAS_INGREDIENT).

   5. The 'Patient' node also has two edges connected to the 'Medication' and 'Ingredient' nodes respectively. One edge (type_: ALLERGIC_TO) indicates that this patient is allergic to this medication, but it seems there might be an error with this edge as 'is_error' is set to '1'. The other edge (type_: TAKES_MEDICATION) indicates that the patient started taking this medication on '1998-11-07T17:27:52Z' and stopped on '1999-03-13T17:27:52Z'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
