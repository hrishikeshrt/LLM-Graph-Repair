Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'naproxen' and property 'tau_o' set to 1. This node also has a medication associated with it, identified by the code '897718', description 'verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet', and labeled as 'Medication'.

   Another node is labeled as 'Patient' with ID 'a708bca4-8fc9-4567-8c22-8b13d44f4f45'. This patient's details include the first name 'Weldon459', last name 'Effertz744', birthdate '1944-04-14', address '356 Kuhn Grove Suite 62', and no death date.

   The patient node is connected to the 'Ingredient' node by an edge of type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This edge has a property 'tau_o' set to 1, indicating that this medication is currently associated with the patient.

   There is also an edge connecting the 'Patient' node to the 'Medication' node, of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. This edge indicates that the patient started taking this medication on '1999-11-05T04:27:38Z' and stopped on '1999-12-31T04:27:38Z'.

   Additionally, there is an edge connecting the 'Patient' node to the 'Ingredient' node of type 'ALLERGIC_TO', but this edge does not indicate any start or stop dates.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
