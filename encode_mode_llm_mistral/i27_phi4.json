The `Ingredient` node with ID 'oxycodone' has a property `'tau_o'` set to 1, which might be incorrect given that it is related to an allergy and medication context where typically such properties should not have positive values unless explicitly justified.\n2. The edge `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]` between the `Medication` node and the `Ingredient` node has a property `'tau_o': 1` and an error flag `'is_error': 1`, indicating potential issues with this relationship that need correction to reflect accurate data.\n\nThese repairs aim to correct these inconsistencies by setting `'tau_o'` to 0, which is more consistent with the context of allergies and medication ingredients. The error flag on the edge is also set to 0 to indicate no error.",
