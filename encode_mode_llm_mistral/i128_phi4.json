The `Ingredient` node with ID 'oxycodone' has an incorrect property `tau_o`. It should be updated to reflect the absence of a known allergy.\n2. Similarly, the `Medication` node with code '205923' incorrectly has a `tau_o` property set to 1. This should also be corrected.\n3. The edge `[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]` from the patient to the ingredient indicates no known allergies, which contradicts the presence of an allergy-related property on the ingredient and medication nodes. Therefore, this relationship is updated to reflect that there are no allergies by removing its properties or setting them appropriately. In this case, simply updating the edge to remove any implied properties suffices.",
