Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'mestranol'. Its property 'tau_o' is set to 1.
  2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', specifically 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension' with code '106892'. Its properties include 'tau_o' set to 1 and a 'description'.
  3. A third node represents a 'Patient' named Earle679, born on May 7, 1917, residing at 208 Kilback Center Unit 20, who passed away on January 23, 2018.
  4. The 'Medication' node is related to the 'Ingredient' node through an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT with a property indicating that mestranol is an ingredient in Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension.
  5. The 'Patient' node is connected to both the 'Ingredient' and 'Medication' nodes through separate edges. One edge of type ALLERGIC_TO has no specified start or stop dates, indicating an ongoing allergy. Another edge of type TAKES_MEDICATION specifies a start date of July 25, 2016, and a stop date of September 26, 2016, meaning the patient took this medication from that date range.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
