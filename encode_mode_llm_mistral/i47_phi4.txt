Explanation of the repairs:
1. **DEL_EDGE** on `[rc]`: Remove the incorrect `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the Patient and a node that is incorrectly labeled as both Medication and Ingredient.
2. **UPD_NODE**: Correct the label for the node with ID `'b5581474-7033-4586-bc95-da6a508bdab6'` to only be `Ingredient`, removing its incorrect Medication label.
3. **ADD_NODE**: Create a new Medication node using the properties of the incorrectly labeled node, ensuring that both Ingredient and Medication information is correctly represented in separate nodes.
4. **DEL_EDGE** on `[ra]`: Remove the erroneous `ALLERGIC_TO` edge due to its error flag (`is_error: '1'`). This suggests incorrect or inconsistent data about allergies.
