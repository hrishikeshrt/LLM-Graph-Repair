Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         Node with ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1' (Patient) has properties including the name 'Logan497', birthdate '1913-05-30', address '1081 Orn Street', and deathdate '2009-05-02'.
   The same node also has a label 'Ingredient' with ID 'oxycodone'.
   Another Node with ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' (Medication) has properties such as code '205923', description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', and tau_o 1.
   The Medication node is also related to the Patient through an edge of type TAKES_MEDICATION, with start date '2001-01-19T23:35:03Z' and stop date '2001-01-19T23:35:03Z'.
   The Patient is also related to the Ingredient through an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT, with a property indicating an error '1'.
   Additionally, there exists an edge of type ALLERGIC_TO between the Patient and Medication nodes, without any specific start or stop dates.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
