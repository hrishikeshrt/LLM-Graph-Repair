Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         Node with ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b' is labeled as a Patient, named Walker122, born on 1914-09-06 and deceased on 1977-03-19. The address of this patient is '524 Brekke Dale Suite 9'.

   Another node with ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' has multiple labels: Medication and Ingredient. The medication, labeled as 'epoetin alfa', has the code '205923' and its description is '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'.

   There is an edge connecting the Patient node and the Medication node labeled as TAKES_MEDICATION. The medication taken by this patient started on 1970-05-03T09:30:42Z and stopped at an unspecified date (indicated by an error).

   Another edge connects the Patient node and the Ingredient node labeled as HAS_INGREDIENT. The ingredient 'epoetin alfa' is associated with this medication without any errors or specific time constraints.

   Lastly, there is an edge connecting the Patient node and the Medication node labeled as ALLERGIC_TO. This indicates that there is an allergy to this medication, but the start and stop dates are unspecified (indicated by an error).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
