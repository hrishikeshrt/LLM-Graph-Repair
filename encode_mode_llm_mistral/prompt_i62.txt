Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         There is a node labeled as an Ingredient (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691) with the property 'id' set to 'ferrous sulfate'.

   There is another node labeled as a Medication (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750) with the properties 'code' set to '860975', 'description' set to '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet', and 'id' set to an empty string.

   There is a node labeled as a Patient (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840) with the properties 'address' set to '935 Rempel Trail', 'birthdate' set to '1923-06-22', 'last' set to 'Fritsch593', 'first' set to 'Sanford861', and 'id' set to '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'.

   The Ingredient node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691) has an edge connecting it to the Medication node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750), with the type set to HAS_INGREDIENT.

   The Patient node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840) has two edges connecting it to the Ingredient node and the Medication node respectively. The edge connecting to the Ingredient node is labeled with type_ set to ALLERGIC_TO, and the one connecting to the Medication node is labeled with type_ set to TAKES_MEDICATION.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
