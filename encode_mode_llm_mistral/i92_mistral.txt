Explanation: The current graph has an inconsistency where the medication 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension' has a relationship with the ingredient 'mestranol', but it is marked as an error. To fix this, we update the edge `rc` (HAS_INGREDIENT) to remove the 'is_error' property or set it to '0'. Similarly, the patient 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1' has a relationship with 'mestranol' that is not marked as an error. To maintain consistency, we update the edge `ra` (ALLERGIC_TO) to mark it as an error by setting 'is_error' to '1'.
