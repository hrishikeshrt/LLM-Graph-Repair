Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

First, there are two nodes with the same ID: 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93'. One is labeled as Medication and has properties like code, description, and tau_o. The other is labeled as Ingredient and only has id and tau_o. That's a problem because each node should have a unique ID.

So, I think the solution is to remove one of these nodes so they don't conflict. Since the Medication label probably makes more sense for that node, maybe we should delete the Ingredient node with that ID.

I'll suggest using the DEL_NODE operation on 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' labeled as Ingredient. That way, it's removed from the graph without any changes needed to edges or other nodes.
