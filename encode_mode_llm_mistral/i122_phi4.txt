The inconsistency arises because a medication node (`Fritsch593`) cannot simultaneously be both a medication and an ingredient. This dual role leads to logical errors, as medications should not have themselves as ingredients. Additionally, the patient is allergic to this medication/ingredient, which complicates the situation further.

To resolve these issues, we need to:

1. Remove the relationship where `Fritsch593` acts as both a medication and an ingredient.
2. Correct any allergy information related to this inconsistency.
