The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the fact that a patient who takes a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to should not be taking that medication. The relationships indicate that the patient is both taking the medication and is allergic to one of its ingredients, which is contradictory.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient is taking the medication. This ensures that the graph accurately reflects that a patient with an allergy to an ingredient should not be consuming any medications containing that ingredient.
