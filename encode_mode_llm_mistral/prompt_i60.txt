Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         Node with ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d' is labeled as a Patient. It has properties such as first name "Sanford861", last name "Fritsch593", birthdate '1923-06-22', address '935 Rempel Trail', and no deathdate.

   Node with ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' is labeled as both Ingredient and Medication. The Ingredient has the property 'id' set to 'ferrous sulfate' and 'tau_o' set to 1. The Medication is described by properties such as 'code' '860975', 'description' '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet', and also has a 'tau_o' of 1.

   There is an Edge connecting the Patient node to the Ingredient node, with type HAS_INGREDIENT. It has properties indicating that the patient has the ingredient (ferrous sulfate) in their medication, with no errors.

   Another Edge connects the Patient node to the Medication node, with type TAKES_MEDICATION. This edge indicates that the patient started taking this medication on '2011-08-19T09:55:43Z' and stopped on '2011-09-16T09:55:43Z'.

   Lastly, there is an Edge connecting the Patient node to the Ingredient node, with type ALLERGIC_TO. This edge indicates that the patient has no known allergies to this ingredient (ferrous sulfate).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
