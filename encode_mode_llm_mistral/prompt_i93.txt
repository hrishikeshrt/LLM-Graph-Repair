Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'mestranol'. It has a property 'tau_o' with value 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', with code '106892' and description 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension'. This node also has a property 'tau_o' with value 1.

   3. A third node represents a 'Patient' named Logan497, with the last name Brekke496. The patient was born on May 30, 1913, and died on May 2, 2009. This node also has an empty 'tau_k' property.

   4. The first edge connects the 'Medication' node to the 'Ingredient' node, indicating that the medication contains mestranol. It has a property 'tau_o' with value 1 and an 'is_error' property set to '1'.

   5. There is an edge connecting the 'Patient' node to the 'Ingredient' node, indicating that the patient is allergic to mestranol. This edge has an empty 'properties' section.

   6. Another edge connects the 'Patient' node to the 'Medication' node, indicating that the patient takes Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension. The properties of this edge include a start date (2000-05-26T23:35:03Z), a stop date (2000-07-28T23:35:03Z), and an 'is_error' property set to '0'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
