The inconsistency identified in the graph involves an edge with `is_error` set to '1', indicating a potential error in the relationship between the medication and its ingredient. Additionally, both the medication and ingredient nodes have the same `tau_o` value of 1, which might suggest incorrect data or duplication.

To address these issues:

1. **Remove the erroneous edge**: The `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge has an `is_error` property set to '1', indicating it is likely incorrect.
2. **Update the `tau_o` properties**: Both the medication and ingredient nodes have a `tau_o` of 1, which might be inconsistent with their actual status or usage.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
UPD_NODE | m:Medication | tau_o=0
UPD_NODE | i:Ingredient | tau_o=0
