Explanation: The ingredient and medication nodes have a non-zero value for the 'tau_o' property, which suggests an inconsistency. To fix this, we set their 'tau_o' values to 0. Then, since the patient is currently taking the medication but has no ongoing prescription, we add a new edge from the patient to the medication node with a start date and an open-ended stop date (represented by '-'). This edge will replace the existing edges connecting the patient to the medication node.
