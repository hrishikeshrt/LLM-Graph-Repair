Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. Node with ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b' is labeled as a Patient, identified as Walker122, born on 1914-09-06 and deceased on 1977-03-19. The address of this patient is '524 Brekke Dale Suite 9'.

  2. Another node with the same ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b' has a different label, Medication, and is identified as a product with code '205923'. The description of this medication is '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'.

  3. The same node also has an Ingredient label and its ID is 'epoetin alfa'.

  4. There is an edge connecting the Patient node and the Ingredient node, indicating that the patient has the ingredient epoetin alfa.

  5. Another edge connects the Patient node with the Medication node, suggesting that the patient takes the medication with code '205923'. The start and stop dates for this medication are 1969-02-01T09:30:42Z.

  6. There is also an edge connecting the Patient node and the Ingredient node, but it indicates that the patient is allergic to this ingredient. The error status for this edge is '1', suggesting there might be some inconsistency or uncertainty in this data.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
