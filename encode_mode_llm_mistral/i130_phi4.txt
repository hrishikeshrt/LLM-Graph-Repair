Based on the description provided, it appears that there are inconsistencies related to the properties of nodes and edges. Specifically, the `tau_o` property being set to 1 for both an Ingredient node and a Medication node might indicate an error if this value is not supposed to be shared or should have different values in these contexts.

Here's a suggested repair plan:

1. If `tau_o` equal to 1 is incorrect for either the Ingredient or Medication, update it accordingly.
2. The edge `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]` has a property `is_error` set to '0', but there might be an error if the patient is allergic to this ingredient. Consider updating this property.

UPD_NODE | (i) | {tau_o: 0}
