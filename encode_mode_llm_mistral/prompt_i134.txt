Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         There are three nodes in this graph. The first node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6776) is an Ingredient with the ID 'mestranol'.

   The second node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6786) is a Medication, specifically Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, with the code '106892'.

   The third node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6223) represents a Patient with the name Boyd728 and last name Beahan375, born on 1911-11-19 and died on 1975-11-03.

   There are also three edges connecting these nodes. The first edge connects the Medication node to the Ingredient node, indicating that mestranol is an ingredient of Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension.

   The second edge links the Patient node to the Ingredient node, suggesting that this patient is allergic to mestranol. The 'start' and 'stop' properties for this edge are empty, indicating an unknown start and end date for the allergy.

   Lastly, there is an edge connecting the Patient node to the Medication node, implying that this patient took Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension from 1961-01-08T19:05:21Z to 1961-02-19T19:05:21Z.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
