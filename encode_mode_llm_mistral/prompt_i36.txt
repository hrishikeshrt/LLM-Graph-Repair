Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'clopidogrel'. It has a property 'tau_o' with the value 1.

   2. The same node also has another label, 'Medication', and it is associated with the description 'Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet'. This node also has properties 'code' (309362) and 'tau_o' (1).

   3. There is a third node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. It has properties such as 'first name' (Sanford861), 'last name' (Fritsch593), 'address' (935 Rempel Trail), 'birthdate' (1923-06-22), and 'tau_o' (0).

   4. The node representing the medication (Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet) is connected to the patient node via an edge of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. This edge has properties indicating that the patient started taking this medication on 2008-04-11 and stopped on 2008-05-09.

   5. The same medication node is also connected to the patient node via an edge of type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This edge has a property indicating that the ingredient (clopidogrel) is not in error.

   6. Additionally, there is an edge of type 'ALLERGIC_TO' connecting the patient node to the medication node. This edge indicates that the patient has an allergy to this medication with properties suggesting that the start and stop dates are empty (not specified).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
