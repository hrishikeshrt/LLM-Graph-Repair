Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix these inconsistencies in the graph. Let me go through each point step by step.

First, there are two nodes with 'tau_o' set to 1: one for warfarin (an ingredient) and another for Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet (a medication). That doesn't make sense because they're different entities. I think we should remove the 'tau_o' property from these nodes since it's causing a conflict.

Next, there's an edge between the patient and the medication that has start and stop dates. But then there's another edge from the patient to themselves with just a name. That seems like a typo or maybe a mistake in how relationships are set up. I should remove that self-loop edge because it doesn't make sense.

So, putting it all together, I'll delete the 'tau_o' properties for both nodes and also remove the incorrect self-edge.

DEL_PROPERTY | [warfarin] | tau_o: 1
DEL_PROPERTY | [Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet] | tau_o: 1
