To address the inconsistency, we need to ensure that the patient's allergy and medication records are accurate. The inconsistency arises because the patient is allergic to an ingredient ("mestranol") in a medication they take ("Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension"). This situation suggests either:

2. The allergy information might be incorrect.

Assuming the allergy information is correct, the logical repair would be to prevent the patient from being prescribed or taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. Therefore, we should remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication.

Here's the suggested repair:
