Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'ferrous sulfate'. Its property 'tau_o' is set to 1.

   2. Another node is labeled as 'Medication', with the code '860975' and description '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet'. This node also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   3. A third node is labeled as 'Patient', with the ID 'cecb7ece-fb70-4a7f-b51d-6e8dd1506ad9'. This patient's properties include 'first name' Isiah14, 'last name' Fritsch593, birthdate 1951-01-06, address '690 Stark Vista', and no deathdate.

   4. The ingredient (ferrous sulfate) has an edge connected to the medication node. This edge is of type HAS_INGREDIENT, with a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and an error flag 'is_error' set to '1'.

   5. The patient node also has two edges connected to the nodes representing the medication and ingredient. One edge of type ALLERGIC_TO, with no start or stop dates and an error flag 'is_error' set to '0'. Another edge is of type TAKES_MEDICATION, with a start date 2017-11-04T06:11:10Z and a stop date 2017-12-09T06:11:10Z. The error flag for this edge is 'is_error' set to '0'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
