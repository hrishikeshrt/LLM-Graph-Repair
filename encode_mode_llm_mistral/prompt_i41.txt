Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'mestranol'. It has a property 'tau_o' of 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '106892' and description 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension'. This node also has a 'tau_o' property of 1.

   3. A third node is present, labeled as 'Patient' with ID '09cbb3f1-c2ed-426c-8c53-ffda77efcb08'. This patient's first name is 'Moises22', last name 'Kerluke267', birthdate '1950-02-26', and death date '2010-09-01'.

   4. The ingredient node with ID 'mestranol' is connected to the medication node through an edge of type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This edge has a property 'tau_o' of 1 and 'is_error' as '1'.

   5. The patient node is also connected to the ingredient node through an edge of type 'ALLERGIC_TO'. This edge does not have any properties indicating start or stop dates, and 'is_error' is '0'.

   6. Lastly, the patient node is connected to the medication node through an edge of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. This edge has properties indicating that the patient started taking this medication on '2002-05-05T09:59:52Z' and stopped on '2002-08-25T09:59:52Z', with 'tau_o' as 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
