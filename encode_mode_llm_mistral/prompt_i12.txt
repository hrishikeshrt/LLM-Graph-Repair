Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the unique identifier 'oxycodone'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. It also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   3. There is a node labeled as 'Patient' with the unique identifier 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1'. It has properties such as 'address', 'birthdate', 'last', 'first', 'deathdate', and 'id'.

   4. The node with identifier 'oxycodone' is connected to the 'Ingredient' of the medication through an edge labeled as 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This connection has a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'is_error' set to '1'.

   5. The patient node is connected to both the 'Ingredient' and the 'Medication' nodes through edges. One edge connects the patient to the 'Ingredient' with label 'ALLERGIC_TO', properties include 'tau_o' set to 0, and 'is_error' set to '0'.

   6. Another edge connects the patient to the 'Medication' node with label 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. This connection has properties such as 'start' and 'stop' dates, and 'tau_o' set to 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
