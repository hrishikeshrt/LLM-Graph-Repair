Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'.

   3. A third node represents a 'Patient' with the ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d', name 'Sanford861', and address '935 Rempel Trail'.

   4. The node labeled as 'Ingredient' (oxycodone) has an edge connected to the 'Medication' node, indicating it has the ingredient.

   5. The 'Patient' node is also connected to both the 'Ingredient' and 'Medication' nodes. The connection to the 'Ingredient' node indicates an allergy (allergic_to), while the connection to the 'Medication' node shows that the patient takes the medication (takes_medication). The start and stop dates for these connections are specified in the properties of the edges.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
