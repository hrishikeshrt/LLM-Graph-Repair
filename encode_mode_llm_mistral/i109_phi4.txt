The inconsistency arises because the patient with ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d' is allergic to an unknown entity, but they are taking a medication ('205923') that contains an ingredient ('oxycodone') to which they are allergic. To resolve this, we need to ensure the allergy relationship reflects the known ingredient 'oxycodone'.

Explanation: The `ALLERGIC_TO` edge should be updated to connect the patient to the specific ingredient 'oxycodone', ensuring the graph accurately represents the patient's allergy. Since the target node for the allergy is already known, no new nodes or edges need to be added; only the existing relationship needs to be corrected by removing any ambiguity and explicitly linking it to the correct ingredient node.
