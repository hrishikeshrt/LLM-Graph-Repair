Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'epoetin alfa'. It also has the property 'tau_o' set to 1.
  2. The same node is also labeled as 'Medication', with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. It too has 'tau_o' set to 1.
  3. There is a node labeled as 'Patient' with ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b'. Its properties include 'first' (Walker122), 'last' (Kuhic920), 'address' (524 Brekke Dale Suite 9), 'birthdate' (1914-09-06), and 'deathdate' (1977-03-19).
  4. The 'Ingredient' node is connected to the 'Medication' node by an edge of type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This edge also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'is_error' set to '0'.
  5. The 'Patient' node is connected to the 'Ingredient' node by an edge of type 'ALLERGIC_TO'. This edge has 'is_error' set to '1', indicating a potential error in the data.
  6. The 'Patient' node is also connected to the 'Medication' node by an edge of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. This edge indicates that the patient started taking this medication on 1976-07-18 at 09:30:42 and there is no specified stop date.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
