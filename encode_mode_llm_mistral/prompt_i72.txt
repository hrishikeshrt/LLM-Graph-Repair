Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'epoetin alfa'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', also with the same ID 'epoetin alfa'. Its properties include 'code' set to '205923', 'description' set to '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', and 'tau_o' set to 1.

   3. There is a node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b'. Its properties include 'first name' set to 'Walker122', 'last name' set to 'Kuhic920', 'address' set to '524 Brekke Dale Suite 9', 'birthdate' set to '1914-09-06', 'deathdate' set to '1977-03-19', and 'tau_o' set to 0.

   4. The 'Ingredient' node is connected to the 'Medication' node by an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT with a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'is_error' set to '0'.

   5. The 'Patient' node is connected to the 'Ingredient' node by an edge of type ALLERGIC_TO with a property 'is_error' set to '1'.

   6. The 'Patient' node is also connected to the 'Medication' node by an edge of type TAKES_MEDICATION with properties 'start' and 'stop' both set to '1967-04-28T09:30:42Z' and 'tau_o' set to 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
