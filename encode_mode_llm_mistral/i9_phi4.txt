```xml
<repairs>
    UPD_NODE | i:Ingredient {id: 'oxycodone'} | tau_o = 0
    UPD_NODE | m:Medication {code: '205923'} | tau_o = 0
    UPD_EDGE | [rc] | tau_o = 0, is_error = 0
</repairs>
``` 

This set of operations corrects the `tau_o` property for both the ingredient and medication nodes to 0, ensuring consistency with typical values. It also updates the edge properties to reflect that there are no errors (`is_error = 0`) and aligns the `tau_o` value on the relationship with those of the connected nodes.
