      UPD_NODE | [m] | {'description': '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, contains oxycodone'}
      DEL_EDGE | [ra] | [-]
   </repairs>

The first repair operation updates the description of the medication node to reflect that it contains oxycodone. The second repair operation removes the edge connecting the patient to the ingredient, as the allergy information seems incorrect since the medication contains the ingredient the patient is supposedly allergic to.
