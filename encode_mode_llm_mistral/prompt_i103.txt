Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'hydrochlorothiazide'. It also has a property 'tau_o' of 1.
  2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', which is described as 'HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet' and has a code '310798'. This node also has a 'tau_o' of 1.
  3. A third node represents a 'Patient' with the ID '09616ead-22c8-4210-8cb9-2fdc28e043ca'. The patient's first name is 'Christena299', last name is 'Lang846', birthdate is '1953-08-03', and address is '124 Fadel Dam Apt 81'.
  4. The medication node (HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet) has an edge connecting to the ingredient node (hydrochlorothiazide). This relationship is of type HAS_INGREDIENT and has a property 'tau_o' of 1, with no error.
  5. The patient node (Christena Lang846) also has two edges connected to the medication node. One edge indicates that the patient is allergic to the medication (type ALERGIC_TO, with an error property of 1). The other edge shows that the patient takes the medication (type TAKES_MEDICATION), with a start date of '1983-12-05T05:08:34Z' and a stop date of '1984-12-10T05:08:34Z'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
