   UPD_NODE | [i] | {'tau_o': 0}
   DEL_EDGE | [ra] | {'target': 'i'}
   </repairs>

Explanation: The patient is allergic to the ingredient, but the ingredient node has a tau_o of 1, which suggests it should not be an allergen. Therefore, we update the ingredient's tau_o property to 0 and delete the edge connecting the patient to the ingredient. This repair ensures that the graph is factually accurate by removing the incorrect allergy information.
