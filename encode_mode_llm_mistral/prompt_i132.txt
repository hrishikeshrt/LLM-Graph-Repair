Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'metformin'.
  2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', which has the code '860975' and description '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet'.
  3. A third node represents a patient named Reyna401, with ID '53f3587e-b9bf-473a-b36e-62f0e1946fa1', and details including address '824 Schuppe Gate Unit 70' and birthdate '1949-02-26'.
  4. The medication node is connected to the ingredient node through an edge labeled as 'HAS_INGREDIENT'.
  5. The patient node is connected to the medication node through an edge labeled as 'TAKES_MEDICATION', indicating that the patient takes this medication from a specific start date to a specific stop date.
  6. Additionally, there is another edge connecting the patient node to the medication node, labeled as 'ALLERGIC_TO'. This suggests that the patient may have an allergy or adverse reaction to this medication.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
