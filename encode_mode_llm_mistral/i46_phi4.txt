The inconsistency identified in the graph involves a patient being marked as allergic to a medication, but this relationship has an error flag set. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the allergy information was recorded or processed.

To address this, we should remove the erroneous edge indicating the allergy to the medication since it is flagged as incorrect (`is_error` set to `1`). This will ensure that the graph accurately reflects the patient's known allergies without misleading data.
