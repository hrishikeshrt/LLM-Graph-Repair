Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the identifier 'ferrous sulfate'. It also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', with the code '860975' and description '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet'. This node also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   3. There is a third node labeled as 'Patient', with the id 'cecb7ece-fb70-4a7f-b51d-6e8dd1506ad9'. This patient's first name is Isiah14, last name Fritsch593, birthdate 1951-01-06, and address 690 Stark Vista.

   4. The 'Ingredient' node (ferrous sulfate) has an edge connected to the 'Medication' node with a type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This edge also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'is_error' set to '1'.

   5. The 'Patient' node (Isiah14 Fritsch593) has an edge connected to the 'Ingredient' node with a type 'ALLERGIC_TO'. This edge does not have any error and its properties include empty 'start' and 'stop' fields.

   6. The 'Patient' node (Isiah14 Fritsch593) also has an edge connected to the 'Medication' node with a type 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. This edge does not have any error, and its properties include 'start' date 1989-05-27T06:11:10Z and 'stop' date 1989-07-01T06:11:10Z.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
