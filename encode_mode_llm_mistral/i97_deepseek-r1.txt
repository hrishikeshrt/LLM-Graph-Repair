Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are two nodes with the same ID 'mestranol': one labeled as an Ingredient and another as a Medication. Both have properties like 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'id' set to 'mestranol'. That seems problematic because each node should have a unique combination of label and properties, right? So having two nodes with the same ID but different labels is causing duplication.

Looking at the relationships, the medication Humulin 70/30 is connected to mestranol via HAS_INGREDIENT. But since there's another node with the same ID labeled as Medication, this edge might be pointing to the wrong node or not making sense in context. Also, the patient took this medication between specific dates, which connects them through TAKES_MEDICATION.

The allergy information is connected correctly but seems redundant because of the duplicate node issue. So I think the main problem lies with these two nodes having conflicting labels and properties.

To fix this, I should probably remove one of the nodes to eliminate the duplication. Since both have the same 'id' and 'tau_o', it's likely that they're representing different entities but are mistakenly created as separate nodes when they shouldn't be. Maybe the intention was for 'mestranol' to only exist once, either as an ingredient or a medication.

So I'll suggest deleting one of these nodes. Let me choose to delete the Medication node because it's more specific in this context. That way, we avoid having two entries for the same ID and label combination.
