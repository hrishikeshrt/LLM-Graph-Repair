  "content": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help fix this graph inconsistency. Let me look at what's going on here.\n\nFirst, there are two nodes with the same ID 'epoetin alfa' but different labels: one is a Medication and the other is an Ingredient. That seems like a problem because each node should have a unique combination of label and properties, right? So I need to decide which one to keep or modify.\n\nThen, looking at their properties, the Medication has more details like 'code' and 'description', while the Ingredient only has 'tau_o'. The edges connecting them also have different 'tau_o' values. That might be causing some issues in how they're used elsewhere in the graph.\n\nI think the best approach is to remove the extra information from the Medication node so it matches the Ingredient node's properties for 'tau_o'. That way, both nodes are consistent and avoid duplication.\n\nSo I'll suggest deleting the 'code' and 'description' properties from the Medication node. This should fix any inconsistencies caused by having two different nodes with the same ID but different labels.\n</think>\n\n<repairs>\nUPD_NODE | [medication] | code: -, description: -\n</repairs>",
