   The first set of repairs updates the 'Ingredient' node with ID 'warfarin', removes the existing relationship between the 'Medication' and 'Ingredient' nodes, and sets the 'tau_o' property of the 'Medication' node to 0. This is because the 'tau_o' property should not be set for a 'Medication' node.

   The second set of repairs updates the edge connecting the patient to the medication with label 'ALLERGIC_TO', removing the 'is_error' property, which indicates that there might be an error in the data. This is because it is unusual to have an allergy without specific start or stop dates.
