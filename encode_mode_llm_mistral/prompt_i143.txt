Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'olmesartan'. Its tau value is 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', which has a code '999967' and a description "Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG / Olmesartan medoxomil 20 MG Oral Tablet [Tribenzor]". Its tau value is also 1.

   3. There is another node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '2c71dd97-7085-416a-aa07-d675bbe3adf2'. This patient's first name is 'Samatha845', last name is 'Mueller846', and birthdate is '1941-02-14'. The tau value of this node is 0, which means it has not been observed yet.

   4. There is an edge connecting the 'Medication' node to the 'Ingredient' node, indicating that Olmesartan is an ingredient in this medication. This edge has a key '5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51923' and type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'.

   5. There is an edge connecting the 'Patient' node to the 'Ingredient' node, indicating that this patient is allergic to Olmesartan. This edge has a key '5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:990' and type 'ALLERGIC_TO'.

   6. There is another edge connecting the 'Patient' node to the 'Medication' node, indicating that this patient takes this medication. This edge has a key '5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:724', type 'TAKES_MEDICATION', and properties for start and stop dates.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
