Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are two nodes: 'Medication' and 'Ingredient'. The medication node has a property called tau_o set to 1, which includes a description. The ingredient node also has tau_o set to 1 but doesn't have any properties listed. 

Looking at the relationships, the patient is connected to both the medication and the ingredient via specific edges like TAKES_MEDICATION and ALLERGIC_TO. These edges probably represent some kind of association or relationship between entities.

The problem seems to be that the 'Medication' node has a tau_o property with a description, while the 'Ingredient' node's tau_o is empty. This inconsistency might cause issues in how these nodes are treated or displayed in the graph.

I think the first step would be to remove the tau_o property from the 'Medication' node since it doesn't have any associated values. That way, both nodes will have consistent properties. Then, maybe add a tau_o property with appropriate details to the 'Ingredient' node so that both nodes align in their information.

So, I'll suggest deleting the tau_o edge on the medication node and adding it back to the ingredient node with relevant details like the description.

DEL_EDGE | [tau_o] | -
ADD_EDGE | [tau_o] | {type: 'tau_o', key: 'description', value: '...'}
