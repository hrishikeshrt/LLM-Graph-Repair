Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'epoetin alfa'. It has a property 'tau_o' of 1.

   2. The same node is also labeled as 'Medication', and it has additional properties: 'code' set to '205923', 'description' set to '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', and 'tau_o' still set to 1.

   3. There is another node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b'. It has properties: 'address' set to '524 Brekke Dale Suite 9', 'birthdate' set to '1914-09-06', an empty 'tau_k', 'last' set to 'Walker122', 'first' set to 'Walker', 'tau_o' set to 0, 'deathdate' set to '1977-03-19'.

   4. The node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'epoetin alfa' has an edge connected to it from the node labeled as 'Medication' with the key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52035. The type of this edge is 'HAS_INGREDIENT', and it has a property 'tau_o' set to 1, with no error.

   5. The node labeled as 'Patient' also has an edge connected to the same 'Ingredient' node from the key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:981. The type of this edge is 'ALLERGIC_TO', and it has a property 'is_error' set to '1'.

   6. There is another edge connecting the same 'Patient' node to the 'Medication' node with the ID '205923'. The type of this edge is 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. It has properties: 'start' and 'stop' both set to '1975-06-27T09:30:42Z', 'tau_o' set to 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
