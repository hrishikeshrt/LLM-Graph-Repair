Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'. It has a property 'tau_o' with value 1. A node labeled as 'Medication' with code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection' also exists, with 'tau_o' equal to 1. Another node is a patient identified by ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. This node has labels 'Patient', properties including 'first name' as 'Sanford861', 'last name' as 'Fritsch593', 'birthdate' as '1923-06-22', and 'address' as '935 Rempel Trail'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
