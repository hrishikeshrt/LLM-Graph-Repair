        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'mestranol'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', specifically 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension', with the code '106892'. This node also has a 'tau_o' property set to 1 and a 'description' property.

   3. There is a third node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID 'f9149e25-1799-44bf-a5aa-449b41161345'. This patient's first name is Valrie435, last name is Mertz280, birthdate is 1981-05-26, address is at 939 Gutmann Alley, and has no deathdate.

   4. The 'Medication' node with the description 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension' has an edge connected to the 'Ingredient' node with the ID 'mestranol'. This edge is of type HAS_INGREDIENT and has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   5. The 'Patient' node with the ID 'f9149e25-1799-44bf-a5aa-449b41161345' also has an edge connected to the 'Ingredient' node with the ID 'mestranol'. This edge does not have any properties set.

   6. The 'Patient' node with the ID 'f9149e25-1799-44bf-a5aa-449b41161345' also has an edge connected to the 'Medication' node with the description 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
