Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.
  2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. This node also has a 'tau_o' property set to 1.
  3. A third node is labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. Its properties include 'first name' (Sanford861), 'last name' (Fritsch593), 'birthdate' (June 22, 1923), and 'address' (935 Rempel Trail).
  4. The node representing the 'Medication' is connected to the node representing the 'Ingredient' through an edge with the type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This edge also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and an error flag 'is_error' set to '1'.
  5. The 'Patient' node is connected to both the 'Medication' and 'Ingredient' nodes through separate edges. The edge connecting to the 'Ingredient' has the type 'ALLERGIC_TO', with no start or stop dates, and an error flag 'is_error' set to '0'. The edge connecting to the 'Medication' has the type 'TAKES_MEDICATION', with a start date (October 24, 2016 at 9:55:43 AM) and an end date (empty), and an error flag 'is_error' set to '0'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
