Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

From the description, there's a node with ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b' that's labeled as a Patient named Walker122. This patient was born in 1914 and died in 1977. The address is Brekke Dale Suite 9.

But then, the same node has another label: Medication, with an ID of 'epoetin alfa' and code '205923'. It's described as a product that's an injection. Wait, so this patient is both a Patient and a medication? That doesn't make sense because a patient can't be a medication.

Also, there's another label: Ingredient, with ID 'epoetin alfa', which suggests the same thing—this patient has an ingredient named after themselves as their medication. Then, there are two edges connecting this node to itself via an edge indicating allergy and another for taking medication.

This is clearly conflicting because a patient can't be both a person and a medication. So, I need to remove either the Patient label or the Medication label on this node.

Looking at the example outputs, when there's an inconsistency in edges, they often suggest deleting one of them. Since the patient should only have one identity—either as a person with a medication or just taking a medication—the best approach is to delete the extra label.

So, I'll choose to delete the 'Medication' label on this node because having both Patient and Medication labels doesn't make sense in this context.
