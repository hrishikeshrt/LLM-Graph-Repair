   The medication node has an incorrect is_error property. It should be set to 0, indicating no error. Additionally, since the patient is taking this medication, a TAKES_MEDICATION edge should be added between the Patient and Medication nodes with appropriate start and stop times (as they are currently empty in the provided data).
