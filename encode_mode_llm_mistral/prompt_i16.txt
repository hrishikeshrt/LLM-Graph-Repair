Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'. It has a property 'tau_o' equal to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the ID '205923'. Its description is '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', and it also has a property 'tau_o' equal to 1.

   3. There is a third node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1'. Its first name is 'Logan497', last name is 'Brekke496', birthdate is '1913-05-30', address is '1081 Orn Street', deathdate is '2009-05-02', and it has no properties 'tau_k'.

   4. The medication node with ID '205923' has an edge connected to the ingredient node 'oxycodone'. This edge is of type HAS_INGREDIENT, and it also has a property 'tau_o' equal to 1 and 'is_error' as '1'.

   5. The patient node with ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1' has an edge connected to the ingredient node 'oxycodone'. This edge does not have any error, but it is not specified whether the patient is allergic or not.

   6. The patient node with ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1' also has an edge connected to the medication node '205923'. This edge is of type TAKES_MEDICATION, and it specifies that the patient started taking this medication on '2007-03-16T23:35:03Z', but the stop date is not specified.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
