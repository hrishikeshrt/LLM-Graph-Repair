Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me go through the problem step by step.

First, there are two nodes labeled 'Medication' with different IDs but similar properties. Both have a 'tau_o' set to 1. Then, there's a node 'oxycodone' under 'Ingredient' with 'tau_o' as 1. The patient has 'tau_o' as 0.

Looking at the edges: the 'Patient' is connected to both 'oxycodone' and '205923'. The edge to 'oxycodone' (ALLERGIC_TO) has an empty 'tau_k', but the other edge (TAKES_MEDICATION) has 'tau_o' as 0. 

Wait, so the 'ALLERGIC_TO' edge for 'oxycodone' is marked with empty properties except 'is_error=1'. That might be incorrect because if it's an allergy, maybe there should be some relevant information.

The 'TAKES_MEDICATION' edge has 'tau_o=0', which suggests no error. But the other edges have issues: the 'Medication' node and 'Ingredient' both with tau_o=1 could cause inconsistencies in their respective sections.

I think I need to remove these conflicting nodes and edges to fix the inconsistency.
