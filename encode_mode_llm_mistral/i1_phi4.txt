To address the inconsistency described, we need to focus on the erroneous properties and relationships involving the `tau_o` property set to 1 where it should not be. The key inconsistencies are:

1. The `Ingredient` node 'exemestane' has a `tau_o` property set to 1.
2. The `Medication` node HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet has a `tau_o` property set to 1.
3. The edge `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]` between the ingredient 'exemestane' and the medication HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet has both `tau_o` set to 1 and `is_error` set to 1.

The following repairs are suggested:

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | i | { tau_o: 0 }
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | m | { tau_o: 0 }
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | { tau_o: 0, is_error: 0 }
</repairs>
