Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, there are two nodes with the same ID but different labels and properties: one as an Ingredient and another as a Medication. Also, there are edges connecting them in a way that might not make sense.

First, looking at point 1 and 2, both have the same ID '4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93'. One is an Ingredient with tau_o:1 and id:oxycodone. The other is a Medication with code:205923, description: '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', and tau_o:1. So the same node has two different labels? That seems odd.

Point 4 says there's an edge between this node labeled as Ingredient and another node labeled as Medication with the same ID but label. Wait, that would mean connecting a node to itself? That doesn't make sense in graph theory because edges usually connect distinct nodes.

Similarly, point 5 connects the Patient node to the same ingredient node twice? Or is it connected through an edge labeled ALLERGIC_TO and another TAKES_MEDICATION?

Point 6 has an edge from Patient to Medication with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52065. So the same node is connected as both Ingredient and Medication, which might be causing issues.

So the main problem seems to be that a single node has two different labels (Ingredient and Medication) with conflicting properties. Also, there are edges connecting this node to itself, which isn't valid.

To fix this, I think we should remove the duplicate label on the node. Since it's labeled as both Ingredient and Medication, maybe just keep one label, perhaps the more appropriate one. But since both have tau_o:1, which might be a property indicating something about the relationship, maybe it's better to merge their properties.

Alternatively, if we decide to keep only one label, say Medication, then the properties can be updated to include the details from both. So, in this case, I'll suggest removing the Ingredient label and updating the Medication node with all relevant properties.
