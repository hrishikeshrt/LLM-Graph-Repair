Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'clopidogrel'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', specifically 'Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet'. Its code is '309362' and it also has a 'tau_o' property set to 1.

   3. A third node represents a 'Patient' with the ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. This patient goes by the name Sanford861 and lives at 935 Rempel Trail. The patient does not have any known allergies or deathdate, but was born on June 22, 1923.

   4. The 'Medication' node is connected to the 'Ingredient' node by an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT. This edge has a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'is_error' set to '0'.

   5. The 'Patient' node is connected to both the 'Medication' and 'Ingredient' nodes by edges of types TAKES_MEDICATION and ALLERGIC_TO respectively. The edge of type TAKES_MEDICATION indicates that the patient started taking Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet on January 27, 2017 and stopped on February 17, 2017. The edge of type ALLERGIC_TO suggests that there is an error in the data.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
