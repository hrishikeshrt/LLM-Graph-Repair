Explanation of Repairs:

1. **UPD_NODE** - Update the node for Patient Walker122 to correct the allergy error by setting `is_error` to `0`.
2. **DEL_EDGE** - Remove the relationship `[TAKES_MEDICATION]` between Patient Walker122 and Epoetin Alfa because it is inconsistent with the patient's death date (1977-03-19) as they started taking the medication on 1973-03-09, which overlaps with their lifetime. However, since the end date of medication intake matches the start date, it indicates an error in recording the relationship. Removing this edge resolves the inconsistency.
