Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.
  2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. This node also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.
  3. There is a node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1'. This patient's first name is 'Logan497', last name is 'Brekke496', birthdate is '1913-05-30', and deathdate is '2009-05-02'. The address of this patient is '1081 Orn Street'.
  4. The medication node with the code '205923' has an edge pointing to the ingredient node labeled as 'oxycodone'. This edge is of type 'HAS_INGREDIENT', and it also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1, and 'is_error' set to '1'.
  5. The patient node has two edges. One edge points to the ingredient node labeled as 'oxycodone', and this edge is of type 'ALLERGIC_TO'. This edge does not have any properties specified.
  6. The other edge from the patient node points to the medication node with code '205923'. This edge is of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. It has properties 'start' and 'stop' set to '2004-02-24T23:35:03Z', and 'tau_o' set to 0. The 'is_error' property is set to '0'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
