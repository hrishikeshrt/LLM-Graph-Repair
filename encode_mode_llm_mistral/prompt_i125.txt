Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. It also has a 'tau_o' property set to 1.

   3. A third node is labeled as 'Patient', identified by '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. Its properties include 'first name' as 'Sanford861', 'last name' as 'Fritsch593', 'address' as '935 Rempel Trail', and 'birthdate' as '1923-06-22'.

   4. The node labeled as 'Medication' with the ID '205923' has an edge pointing to the node labeled as 'Ingredient'. This edge is of type 'HAS_INGREDIENT' and its property 'tau_o' is set to 1, while 'is_error' is set to '1'.

   5. The 'Patient' node has an edge pointing to the node labeled as 'Ingredient'. This edge is of type 'ALLERGIC_TO', and its properties include 'tau_o' set to 0, while 'is_error' is set to '0'.

   6. The 'Patient' node also has an edge pointing to the node labeled as 'Medication'. This edge is of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION', with 'start' and 'stop' properties both set to '2013-08-11T09:55:43Z' and 'tau_o' set to 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
