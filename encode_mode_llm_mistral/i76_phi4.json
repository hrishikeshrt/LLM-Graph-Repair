The node with ID 'epoetin alfa' is incorrectly labeled as both 'Ingredient' and 'Medication'. It should only be a 'Medication', so the 'Ingredient' label must be removed.\n2. There is an incorrect edge from the 'Patient' to the 'Ingredient' through the 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship, which indicates an error (`is_error` set to '1'). This suggests that there might not actually be an allergy to this ingredient for the patient, or it was incorrectly recorded as such.\n3. Since 'epoetin alfa' is a medication and not an ingredient itself, any direct relationships from patients regarding allergies should be removed unless they are explicitly defined through another correct path (e.g., via its actual ingredients).\n\nThus, the suggested repairs involve:\n- Updating the node to remove the incorrect label.\n- Deleting the erroneous edge that incorrectly connects the patient to the ingredient.",
