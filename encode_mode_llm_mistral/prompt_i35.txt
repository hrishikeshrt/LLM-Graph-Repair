Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         Node with ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d' is labeled as a Patient, born on June 22, 1923, living at 935 Rempel Trail.
   Node with ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' is labeled as both Medication and Ingredient. The Medication node has the code '309362', description 'Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet', and tau_o of 1. The Ingredient node has label 'Ingredient', a property 'id' set to 'clopidogrel', and also tau_o of 1.
   There is an edge from the Patient node to the Medication node, with type HAS_INGREDIENT. This means that the patient has the ingredient 'clopidogrel'.
   There is an edge from the Patient node to the Medication node, with type TAKES_MEDICATION. This indicates that the patient takes the medication from '2005-04-22' to '2005-05-06'.
   There is another edge from the Patient node to the Ingredient node, with type ALERGIC_TO. This suggests that the patient may be allergic to this ingredient, but there is an error in the data as 'is_error' is set to '1'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
