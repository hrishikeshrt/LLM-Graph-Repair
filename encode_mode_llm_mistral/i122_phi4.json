  "content": "The inconsistency arises because a medication node (`Fritsch593`) cannot simultaneously be both a medication and an ingredient.

Remove the relationship where `Fritsch593` acts as both a medication and an ingredient.\n2. Correct any allergy information related to this inconsistency.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\n</repairs>\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [ra] | -\n</repairs>",
