   The repairs suggest that the node labeled as 'Ingredient' with ID 'oxycodone' should have its 'tau_o' property set to 0, a new edge should be added between the node labeled as 'Medication' and the node labeled as 'Ingredient', connecting them via the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship. The patient node should have its 'tau_o' property set to 1 and the ALLERGIC_TO edge removed. Lastly, the TAKES_MEDICATION edge should have its 'is_error' property set to 0.
