```xml
<repairs>
    UPD_NODE | mestranol | {tau_o: 0}
    UPD_NODE | Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension | {tau_o: 0}
    UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {tau_o: 0, is_error: 0}
</repairs>
``` 

This solution corrects the `tau_o` property and error flag for nodes and edges where they are incorrectly set to indicate an issue (`1`). The assumption here is that a `tau_o` value of `1` indicates an inconsistency or error condition that should be resolved by setting it to `0`, and similarly, any `is_error` flags indicating errors should also be corrected.
