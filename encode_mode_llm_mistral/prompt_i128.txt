Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'. It has a property 'tau_o' of 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. This node also has a 'tau_o' property of 1.

   3. There is a third node labeled as 'Patient' with ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. This patient goes by the first name Sanford861 and last name Fritsch593. The patient's birthdate is on June 22, 1923, and there are no known allergies or deaths recorded.

   4. The 'Medication' node has an edge connected to the 'Ingredient' node, with a property 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This indicates that the medication contains oxycodone.

   5. The 'Patient' node also connects to both the 'Ingredient' and 'Medication' nodes. There is an edge between the patient and the ingredient, with type 'ALLERGIC_TO', indicating no known allergies. Another edge exists between the patient and the medication, with type 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. This indicates that the patient started taking this medication on February 21, 2013, but there is no recorded stop date.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
