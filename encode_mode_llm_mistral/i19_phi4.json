  "content": "The inconsistency arises from a single node being labeled both as `Medication` and `Ingredient`, which should not be the case. Additionally, there are relationships that imply this dual role, such as `TAKES_MEDICATION` and `ALLERGIC_TO` with an ingredient, and `HAS_INGREDIENT` connecting to itself.\n\nTo resolve these inconsistencies:\n\n1. Separate the node into two distinct nodes: one for `Medication` and another for `Ingredient`.\n2. Adjust relationships accordingly:\n   - Remove the incorrect `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship from the Ingredient node.\n   - Add a new `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the Medication and Ingredient nodes.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nADD_NODE | {node:Medication} | {id:'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93', code:'205923', name:'1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'}\nDEL_EDGE | [rm] | -\nADD_NODE | {node:Ingredient} | {id:'oxycodone', tau_o:1}\nADD_EDGE | [rc] | {target:{node:Medication, id:'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93'}, source:{node:Ingredient, id:'oxycodone'}}\n</repairs>",
