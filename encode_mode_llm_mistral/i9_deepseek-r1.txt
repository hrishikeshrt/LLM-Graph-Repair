Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, there are two nodes labeled 'Ingredient' and 'Medication', both with an ID called 'oxycodone'. That seems a bit odd because usually, each node should have a unique identifier, right? Having the same ID for different types of nodes might cause confusion or errors in relationships.

Looking at the details provided, the medication node has an edge pointing to the ingredient node with a property 'tau_o' set to 1. But wait, the 'oxycodone' node also has this 'tau_o' property set to 1 on both itself and the medication node. That might be causing some issues because having the same ID for different nodes could lead to unexpected behavior in queries or data integrity.

Also, the patient node has an edge labeled 'ALLERGIC_TO' pointing to 'oxycodone', which makes sense if the patient is allergic to that ingredient. But since both 'Ingredient' and 'Medication' have 'oxycodone' with the same properties, maybe one of them shouldn't exist or should be merged.

I think the main problem here is the duplicate node ID causing conflicting edges. To fix this, perhaps we can delete the 'oxycodone' node that's a 'Medication'. That way, only the 'Ingredient' node remains with its correct properties and relationships.
