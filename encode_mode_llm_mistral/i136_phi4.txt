The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the fact that a patient has an ID 'naproxen' for an Ingredient, which is not logically correct since patients should have unique identifiers separate from medication or ingredient IDs. Additionally, there seems to be no direct relationship indicating the patient's allergy to any specific ingredient.

To address these issues:

1. Remove the incorrect association of the patient having an ID 'naproxen'.
2. Ensure that if the patient is allergic to any ingredients, this information is correctly represented in the graph.

Here are the suggested repairs:

DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -

This operation removes the incorrect relationship between the medication and the ingredient with the ID 'naproxen', which was incorrectly associated with the patient. 

If there were any specific allergies that needed to be represented, additional `ADD_EDGE` operations would be necessary to correctly link the patient to those ingredients via an allergy relationship. However, based on the provided description, no such relationships are specified beyond the incorrect one.
