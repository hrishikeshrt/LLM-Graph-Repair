However, since we are only provided with a suggestion format and not explicit instructions to delete, updating the edge to reflect the absence of an allergy (e.g., setting properties that indicate no allergy) might be more appropriate.\n- The operation `UPD_EDGE | [ra] | -` suggests modifying or clearing any incorrect properties on the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship to ensure it accurately reflects the lack of allergy. If the relationship should not exist at all, a `DEL_EDGE` would be used instead, but based on the provided format and typical operations, updating is suggested here.",
