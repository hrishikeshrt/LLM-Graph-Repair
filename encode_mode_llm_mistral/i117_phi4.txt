The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves a patient being allergic to an ingredient that is part of a medication they are taking. This situation is problematic because it suggests a potential health risk for the patient, which should be addressed by either removing the medication or updating the allergy information.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to ensure that the patient does not have an allergy relationship with an ingredient present in their medication. Since there is no specific start or stop date provided for the allergy, and it is unclear whether the allergy is still relevant or if the patient has been misdiagnosed, the safest course of action is to remove the ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient and the ingredient 'oxycodone'.

The repair operation suggested below will delete the edge representing the allergy from the patient to the ingredient:

```json
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>
```

This operation removes the potential health risk by ensuring that the graph no longer reflects an incorrect allergy relationship. It is important to note that this repair assumes that the allergy information is incorrect or outdated. If the allergy is still relevant, further investigation and a different course of action would be required, such as updating the medication regimen for the patient.

In summary, the suggested repair operation deletes the edge representing the allergy from the patient to the ingredient 'oxycodone', thus resolving the inconsistency in the graph pattern.
