The inconsistency in this scenario arises from the fact that there are two nodes with the property `tau_o` set to 1, which seems to be an error indicator. The 'Ingredient' node labeled as 'mestranol' and the 'Medication' node with code '106892' both have this property set to 1, indicating potential errors in their respective data entries. Additionally, the edge connecting the 'Ingredient' node to the 'Medication' node has an `is_error` property set to 1, suggesting a known issue with that relationship.

To address these inconsistencies:

1. **Remove the erroneous property from the Ingredient and Medication nodes**: The `tau_o` property is likely used as an error flag and should be removed if it's not applicable or correct for both nodes.
2. **Address the edge error**: Since the edge between 'Ingredient' and 'Medication' has an `is_error` property set to 1, this indicates a known issue with that relationship. If the relationship is incorrect (e.g., mestranol is not actually an ingredient of Humulin 70/30), it should be removed.
