This suggests that there might be an issue with how the allergy information was recorded or processed.\n\nTo address this, we should remove the erroneous edge indicating the allergy to the medication since it is flagged as incorrect (`is_error` set to `1`). This will ensure that the graph accurately reflects the patient's known allergies without misleading data.\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [ra] | -\n</repairs>",
