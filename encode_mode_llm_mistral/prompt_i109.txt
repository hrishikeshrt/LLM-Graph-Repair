Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '205923' and the description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. It also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   3. A third node is present, labeled as 'Patient' with ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. This node has properties such as 'first name: Sanford861', 'last name: Fritsch593', 'birthdate: 1923-06-22', and 'address: 935 Rempel Trail'.

   4. The medication with the ID '205923' has an ingredient, which is 'oxycodone'. This relationship is represented by an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT.

   5. The patient with ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d' is allergic to some unknown entity, which is represented by an edge of type ALLERGIC_TO. No specific details about the allergy are provided.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
