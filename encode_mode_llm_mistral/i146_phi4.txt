Based on the provided description, it appears that there are two main issues to address:

1. The 'ALLERGIC_TO' edge between the patient and the ingredient node has an error indicated by 'is_error' being set to 1.
2. There is no mention of any other factual inconsistency in the relationships or nodes themselves.

To fix these issues, we need to update the properties of the 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship to correct the error status.
