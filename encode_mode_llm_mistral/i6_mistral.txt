   </repairs>

The repair operations suggested are to update the patient node's death date and remove the edge connecting the patient to the medication indicating allergy. This is because the provided data indicates that the patient passed away in 1987, not 2018, and there seems to be a misunderstanding or error regarding the patient's allergies to the medication.
