Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'warfarin'. Its tau value is 1.
  2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', having the code '855332' and description 'Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet'. Its tau value is also 1.
  3. A third node represents a 'Patient' with ID '2c71dd97-7085-416a-aa07-d675bbe3adf2'. This patient's first name is Samatha845, last name is Mueller846, birthdate is 1941-02-14, and address is '531 Collier Wynd'.
  4. The node representing the medication has an edge connected to the ingredient node 'warfarin', indicating that 'Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet' has warfarin as an ingredient.
  5. There is another edge connecting the patient node to the medication node, implying that this patient takes Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet. The start date for this medication is '2019-12-06T20:51:21Z' and the stop date is '2020-01-10T20:51:21Z'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
