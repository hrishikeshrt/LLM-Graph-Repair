The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves a node with the same ID '4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93' being used for both an `Ingredient` and a `Medication`. This is not possible as each node should have a unique identifier across different labels. Additionally, there are edges connecting these nodes inappropriately due to the ID conflict.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. **Separate the Medication Node**: Create a new `Medication` node with a unique ID and update the relationships accordingly.
2. **Remove Incorrect Edge**: Delete the edge between the conflicting `Ingredient` and `Medication` nodes, as they are not distinct entities.

Here's how to perform these operations:

<repairs>
ADD_NODE | (m:Medication) | {id: 'new_unique_id', code: '205923', tau_o: 1, description: '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'}
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
ADD_EDGE | (m)-[:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i) | {tau_o: 1, is_error: '1'}
</repairs>

Explanation of operations:
- **ADD_NODE**: Create a new `Medication` node with a unique ID and the same properties as the original conflicting node.
- **DEL_EDGE**: Remove the incorrect edge between the `Ingredient` and `Medication` nodes due to the ID conflict.
- **ADD_EDGE**: Establish a correct relationship from the newly created `Medication` node to the existing `Ingredient` node.
