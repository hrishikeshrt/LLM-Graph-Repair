Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'oxycodone'.
  2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', having the code '205923' and description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'.
  3. A third node represents a 'Patient' with the ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1', birthdate '1913-05-30', name 'Logan497 LastName496', address '1081 Orn Street', and death date '2009-05-02'.
  4. The medication node is connected to the ingredient node through an edge of type 'HAS_INGREDIENT' with a property indicating that the ingredient is present in the medication (tau_o = 1, is_error = '1').
  5. There is another edge connecting the patient node to the ingredient node, indicating that the patient is allergic to the ingredient (type_: ALLERGIC_TO, properties: {'stop': '', 'start': '', 'tau_o': 0, 'is_error': '0'}).
  6. The patient node is also connected to the medication node through an edge of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION', indicating that the patient started and stopped taking the medication on the same date '2001-03-17T23:35:03Z'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
