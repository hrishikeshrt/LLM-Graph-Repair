Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'ferrous sulfate'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', with the code '860975' and description '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet'. This node also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   3. There is a third node labeled as 'Patient', with the ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. This patient's first name is Sanford861, last name is Fritsch593, birthdate is '1923-06-22', address is '935 Rempel Trail', and has no death date.

   4. The ingredient node is connected to the medication node via an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT. This edge also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1, and an error flag set to '1'.

   5. The patient node is connected to both the ingredient and medication nodes. One connection is of type ALLERGIC_TO with no specific start or stop dates, and another connection is of type TAKES_MEDICATION with a start date of '2000-07-21T09:55:43Z' and a stop date of '2000-09-15T09:55:43Z'. Both these edges have properties 'tau_o' set to 0, and error flags set to '0'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
