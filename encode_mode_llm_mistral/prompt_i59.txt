Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'ferrous sulfate'. It has a property 'tau_o' with value 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication' with the code '860975' and description '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet'. It also has a property 'tau_o' with value 1.

   3. There is a node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. Its properties include 'first name' (Sanford861), 'last name' (Fritsch593), 'birthdate' ('1923-06-22'), 'address' ('935 Rempel Trail'), and 'tau_o' with value 0.

   4. The node labeled as 'Ingredient' is connected to the 'Medication' node via an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT. This edge has a property 'tau_o' with value 1 and 'is_error' as '1'.

   5. The 'Patient' node is connected to both the 'Ingredient' and 'Medication' nodes via edges. One of them is an edge of type ALLERGIC_TO, with properties including 'tau_o' with value 0 and 'is_error' as '0'. The other one is of type TAKES_MEDICATION, with properties including 'start' ('2001-04-13T09:55:43Z'), 'stop' ('2001-06-15T09:55:43Z') and 'tau_o' with value 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
