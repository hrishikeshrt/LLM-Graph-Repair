To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that the patient's allergy and medication records are accurate. The inconsistency arises because the patient is allergic to an ingredient ('oxycodone') that they are also taking as part of a medication.

Here are the suggested repairs:

1. Remove the edge indicating that the patient is allergic to 'oxycodone' if it is confirmed that this allergy information is incorrect or outdated.
2. Alternatively, if the medication should not contain 'oxycodone', remove the edge between the medication and the ingredient.

Assuming the allergy information is incorrect:
