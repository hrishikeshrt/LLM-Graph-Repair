The inconsistency arises because a node labeled as both an Ingredient and a Medication should not exist. The Medication "verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet" (ID: 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93') is incorrectly sharing the same ID with an Ingredient ("naproxen"). This causes confusion in relationships, such as the HAS_INGREDIENT edge between Medication and Ingredient.

To resolve this:

1. Separate the Ingredient node from the Medication node.
2. Correctly link the Patient to the appropriate nodes through their respective edges.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
ADD_NODE | i:Ingredient {id: 'naproxen'} | -
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
ADD_EDGE | (m)-[:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i) | id: '897718'
</repairs>

Explanation:
- `ADD_NODE`: Create a new Ingredient node with the correct identifier.
- `DEL_EDGE`: Remove the incorrect HAS_INGREDIENT edge that connects the Medication to the wrong Ingredient node.
- `ADD_EDGE`: Add a correct HAS_INGREDIENT relationship from the Medication to the newly created Ingredient node.
