Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

First, there are two relationships involving Patient Walker122: one with Epoetin Alfa via 'rm' (TAKES_MEDICATION) and another allergy via 'ra' (ALLERGIC_TO). The problem is that the allergy is marked as an error (is_error = 1), which means it's incorrect. Also, the medication was taken starting from 1973-03-09 but according to the description, it should have been recorded differently.

Looking at the graph structure, I see that both 'rm' and 'rc' are relationships pointing to the same ingredient node because they share the same ID 'epoetin alfa'. That's a problem because each relationship should connect different nodes. So, one of these needs to be removed or fixed.

Since the allergy is marked as an error, maybe it shouldn't exist at all. So I can delete the 'ra' relationship entirely. Then, for the medication, since it was taken starting from 1973-03-09, perhaps that's correct and doesn't need to be changed unless there are more inconsistencies.

So my plan is to remove the allergy relationship because its error status indicates it's incorrect. That should fix part of the inconsistency.
