</repairs>
```

Explanation of the repairs:
- The node with ID 'epoetin alfa' is incorrectly labeled as both an `Ingredient` and a `Medication`. Therefore, we add a new `Medication` node to separate these roles.
- We delete the incorrect `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge that connects the `Ingredient` node directly to itself under the guise of being a `Medication`.
- Finally, we update the properties of the existing `Ingredient` node to ensure it only retains its correct label.
