To address the inconsistency in the graph data, we need to ensure that all relevant details are accurately represented. Here's a structured repair plan:

1. **Add Allergy Details**: Since Patient Walker122 has an allergy but lacks specific details, we should add this information.
2. **Specify Medication Start Date**: The start date for taking Epoetin Alfa is unspecified and should be added if known.

<repairs>
ADD_NODE | (a:Allergy) | {name: 'Epoetin Alfa Allergy'}
ADD_EDGE | [ra] | -
UPD_EDGE | [rm] | {startDate: '1972-01-01'}  // Assuming a start date; adjust if known
</repairs> 

Note: The `startDate` for the medication is assumed as '1972-01-01' due to lack of specific information. Adjust this based on actual data if available.
