      ADD_EDGE | [p, m] | {type_: 'PRESCRIBED_MEDICATION', tau_o: 1}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the existing edge between the Patient and Medication nodes to remove the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship. Then it adds a new PRESCRIBED_MEDICATION relationship to correctly represent the prescription information for the patient and medication. The tau_o property is set to 1 to indicate that this is the current state of the prescription.
