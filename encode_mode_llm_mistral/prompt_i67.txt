Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'epoetin alfa'. This ingredient is also identified as 'epoetin alfa' in medication code 205923, which is described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection".

   2. There is a node labeled as 'Patient' with the ID '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b'. This patient's first name is Walker122 and last name is Kuhic920. The patient was born on 1914-09-06 and died on 1977-03-19.

   3. The ingredient 'epoetin alfa' has a relationship with the patient, specifically it is an ingredient of the medication that the patient takes. This relationship is represented by an edge labeled as 'HAS_INGREDIENT'.

   4. The patient also has a relationship with the medication itself, which is represented by an edge labeled as 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. The start and stop dates for this relationship are 1972-04-10T09:30:42Z.

   5. Additionally, there is an edge labeled as 'ALLERGIC_TO' between the patient and another node. However, this edge has an error ('is_error': '1'), so it seems there might be some inconsistency or incomplete information related to this allergy.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
