The inconsistency in the graph pattern involves multiple nodes and edges having a property `tau_o` set to 1, which likely indicates an error or anomaly. The goal is to correct these erroneous settings.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | i:Ingredient {id: 'ferrous sulfate'} | tau_o=0
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | m:Medication {code: '860975'} | tau_o=0
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | tau_o=0, is_error='0'
</repairs>

These repairs aim to correct the `tau_o` property for the involved nodes and edge by setting it to 0, assuming that a value of 0 indicates no error. Additionally, the `is_error` property on the HAS_INGREDIENT edge is set to '0' to reflect this correction.
