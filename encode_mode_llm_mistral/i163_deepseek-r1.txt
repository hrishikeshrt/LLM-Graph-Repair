Okay, I need to help fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the problem.

So, there are three nodes connected through two edges from a Patient to a Medication and an Ingredient. The first edge connects the Patient (b656a85d-637d-458a-abd8-17219816280f) to the Medication Humulin 70/30 with code 106892. This edge has a 'tau_o' of 1 and is_error as 1.

The second edge connects the Patient to an Ingredient 'mestranol', which also has a 'tau_o' of 1, but its is_error is 0. Also, there's another edge from the Patient to the same Ingredient with is_error 0.

Wait, so the Medication node (Humulin) and the Ingredient node both have edges to the same Patient, each with their own properties. The issue might be that these two nodes are connected through different relationships but should perhaps be unified or separated based on their properties.

Looking at the details: the Medication has 'tau_o' 1 and is_error 1, while the Ingredient has 'tau_o' 1 and is_error 0. This inconsistency suggests a conflict in how they're recorded.

So, maybe we need to remove both edges from the Patient to these nodes because they can't coexist correctly. Alternatively, if one should take precedence, but that's more complex.

I think the simplest fix here is to delete both edges where the Patient connects to the Medication and the Ingredient since their 'tau_o' values are conflicting.
