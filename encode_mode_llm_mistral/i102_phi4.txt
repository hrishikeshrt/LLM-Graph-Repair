The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that a node labeled as an Ingredient (`mestranol`) is mistakenly having properties and relationships typical of a Medication. Specifically, it has a property `tau_o` set to 1, which is unusual for an Ingredient, especially given its connection via a HAS_INGREDIENT relationship from a Medication node. This suggests that the node labeled as an Ingredient should actually be a Medication.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Change the label of the node with ID 'mestranol' from `Ingredient` to `Medication`.
2. Remove the incorrect edge between the Medication node ('Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension') and the incorrectly labeled Ingredient node ('mestranol'), as it is redundant or erroneous given their roles.

Here are the suggested repairs:
