Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are three nodes: 'mestranol' as an Ingredient, 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension' as a Medication, and 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1' as a Patient. 

The relationships are:
1. The Patient takes the medication (TAKES_MEDICATION).
2. The medication has an ingredient (HAS_INGREDIENT).
3. The Patient is allergic to the ingredient (ALLERGIC_TO).

Looking at the properties, both 'mestranol' and 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension' have a 'tau_o' of 1. However, the 'mestranol' node also has an 'is_error' property set to '1', which I assume indicates it's incorrect or invalid.

The issue here is that 'mestranol' should be a valid Ingredient but marked as having an error. Since 'Humulin' doesn't have this 'is_error' property, maybe the inconsistency is because 'mestranol' shouldn't have this either. Alternatively, perhaps the 'is_error' should only apply to certain types of ingredients.

To fix this, I think we need to remove the 'tau_o' and 'is_error' properties from 'mestranol'. This way, it aligns with the other nodes which don't have these properties unless specified otherwise. 

So, applying an UPD_NODE operation on 'mestranol' would be appropriate here. We'll set tau_o to - (meaning remove) and also remove is_error since it's not applicable in this context.

UPD_NODE | mestranol | {tau_o: -, is_error: -}
