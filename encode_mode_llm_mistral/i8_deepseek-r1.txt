Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, there's a Patient node connected to both an Ingredient and a Medication node via two edges: one labeled 'TAKES_MEDICATION' and another 'ALLERGIC_TO'. The Issue is that both the 'Medication' and 'Ingredient' nodes have the same ID 'oxycodone', which doesn't make sense because each node should have a unique identifier.

Looking at the properties, both nodes have 'tau_o' set to 1. Also, there's an edge between them with type 'HAS_INGREDIENT' that has 'tau_o' as 1 and an error flag 'is_error' as '1'. Another edge of type 'ALLERGIC_TO' has 'tau_o' as 0 and 'is_error' as '0'.

So the main problem is the duplicate node IDs. The 'oxycodone' ID is used for both a medication and an ingredient, which should be unique per node.

I think the solution here is to rename one of these nodes so that each has a unique ID. Since they are connected by edges, we need to adjust their IDs accordingly.

Possible steps:
1. Rename the 'oxycodone' medication node to something like 'epogen'.
2. Update all edges connected to this old node's ID to point to the new name.
3. Keep the 'oxycodone' as the ingredient node since it makes sense in that context (like oxycodone being an ingredient).

This way, both nodes have unique IDs, and the relationships are correctly pointing to each without duplication.

I should also consider if any other properties need to be updated or if there's a better way to handle this. But renaming seems straightforward here.
