Explanation of the repairs:
- The node labeled as both `Ingredient` and `Medication` needs to be split. A new `Ingredient` node is created with the ID 'epoetin alfa' and property `tau_o: 1`.
- The existing node, which should only represent a `Medication`, retains its properties but is updated to ensure it is labeled correctly.
- The edge `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]` connecting the `Medication` node to itself as an `Ingredient` is removed. This corrects the logical inconsistency where a medication cannot be its own ingredient.
