The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern suggests that a patient who is allergic to an ingredient should not be taking medication containing that ingredient. In this case, the patient is allergic to 'oxycodone', which is an ingredient of a medication they are currently taking.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen. This can be achieved by deleting the `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge between the patient and the medication nodes.

Here are the suggested repairs:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>
```

This operation removes the relationship that incorrectly indicates the patient is taking a medication they are allergic to.
