        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'ferrous sulfate'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', with the code '860975' and description "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet". This node also has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   3. There is a node labeled as 'Patient', with the ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. This patient's first name is Sanford861, last name is Fritsch593, birthdate is June 22, 1923, and address is '935 Rempel Trail'.

   4. The ingredient node (ferrous sulfate) has an edge connected to the medication node with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51961. The type of this edge is 'HAS_INGREDIENT' and it has a property 'tau_o' set to 1, and an error flag 'is_error' set to '1'.

   5. The patient node (Sanford861 Fritsch593) has an edge connected to the ingredient node with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:980.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
