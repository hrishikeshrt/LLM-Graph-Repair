The inconsistency in this graph pattern arises from a logical contradiction. The patient is both taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic, and such a situation should be addressed for safety reasons.

To resolve this issue factually:

1. **Remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication**: This action prevents the patient from being associated with a medication containing an allergen.

Here's how you can represent these repairs in the specified format:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>
```

This operation removes the edge that indicates the patient is taking the medication, resolving the inconsistency without altering other relationships or properties.
