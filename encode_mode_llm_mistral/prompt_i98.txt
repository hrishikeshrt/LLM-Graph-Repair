Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
         There are three nodes in this graph.

   The first node is labeled as 'Ingredient' and has the property 'mestranol' with an ID of "mestranol".

   The second node is labeled as 'Medication' with the code '106892' and description 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension'.

   The third node is labeled as 'Patient' with the ID "3acf9313-1874-4dff-ab2a-3187516d92d6". This patient's first name is 'Earle679', last name is 'Frami345', birthdate is '1917-05-07', deathdate is '2018-01-23', and address is '208 Kilback Center Unit 20'.

   There are also three edges connecting these nodes. The first edge connects the 'Medication' node to the 'Ingredient' node, indicating that the medication has mestranol as an ingredient.

   The second edge connects the 'Patient' node to the 'Ingredient' node, suggesting that the patient is allergic to mestranol.

   The third edge connects the 'Patient' node to the 'Medication' node, indicating that the patient takes Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension as a medication. The start date of this medication is '2005-11-21T13:57:11Z' and the stop date is '2006-03-06T13:57:11Z'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
