The inconsistency arises because a single node, identified as 'epoetin alfa', is labeled both as an `Ingredient` and a `Medication`. This dual labeling is not factually accurate. To resolve this issue, we need to separate the roles of these entities by ensuring that 'epoetin alfa' is only labeled as either an `Ingredient` or a `Medication`, but not both.

Here are the suggested repairs:

1. **Remove the `Medication` label from the node currently labeled as both `Ingredient` and `Medication`.** This will ensure that 'epoetin alfa' is correctly represented only as an `Ingredient`.

2. **Add a new `Medication` node with the appropriate properties.** This ensures that all medication-specific information remains intact.

3. **Recreate the necessary relationships to maintain the graph's integrity.**
