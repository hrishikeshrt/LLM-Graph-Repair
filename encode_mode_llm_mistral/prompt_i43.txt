Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'chlorthalidone'. It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', specifically 'Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet', with the code '746030'. This node also has a 'tau_o' property set to 1, and a 'description' property.

   3. A third node represents a 'Patient' named Cassandra224, born on August 25, 1935, living at 1028 O'Hara Corner Unit 84. This node has no properties for 'tau_k', 'deathdate', and 'firstname'.

   4. The medication node (Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet) is connected to the ingredient node (chlorthalidone) via an edge labeled as HAS_INGREDIENT. This edge has a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and no error.

   5. The patient node is connected to the medication node via an edge labeled as TAKES_MEDICATION. This edge has properties for 'start' and 'stop' dates, indicating that the patient started taking this medication on November 5, 1956, and stopped on November 11, 1957.

   6. There is another edge connecting the patient node to the medication node, labeled as ALLERGIC_TO. This edge has an 'is_error' property set to 1, suggesting that there may be an error in this data. No specific start or stop dates are provided for this allergy.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
