Explanation:
- The inconsistency lies in the `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the medication '860975' and the ingredient 'ferrous sulfate', which is marked as an error.
- To resolve this, we should remove the erroneous edge `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]`. This operation ensures that the graph accurately reflects only valid relationships.
