Okay, so I'm trying to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me go through each point step by step.

First, there are two nodes with the same ID 'oxycodone'â€”one under 'Medication' and another under 'Ingredient'. That's a problem because each node should have a unique ID. So I need to delete one of them. Since both seem important, maybe I'll remove the one that doesn't make sense in this context. The medication has more details like the description, so perhaps deleting the ingredient version is better.

Next, looking at the edges: there's an edge from '205923' (medication) to 'oxycodone' with HAS_INGREDIENT and tau_o=1. But another edge exists between 'cae10920...' (patient), 'oxycodone', which is just a simple connection without error or allergy info. Since the patient isn't allergic, maybe this edge should be removed because it's incorrect to say they're allergic.

Also, the medication has an edge with TAKES_MEDICATION but no stop date. If that's intentional and there's nothing wrong with having a partial record, I might not need to change anything here unless specified otherwise.

So my plan is to delete both conflicting 'oxycodone' nodes and remove the incorrect allergy edge from the patient.
