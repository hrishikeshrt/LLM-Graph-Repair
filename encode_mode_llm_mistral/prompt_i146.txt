Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with ID 'olmesartan'. Its property 'tau_o' is 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication'. Its properties include 'code' as '999967', 'description' as 'Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG / Olmesartan medoxomil 20 MG Oral Tablet [Tribenzor]', and 'tau_o' is also 1.

   3. There is a node labeled as 'Patient' with ID '2c71dd97-7085-416a-aa07-d675bbe3adf2'. Its properties include 'first name' as 'Samatha845', 'last name' as 'Mueller846', 'address' as '531 Collier Wynd', 'birthdate' as '1941-02-14', and 'tau_o' is 0.

   4. The node with ID 'olmesartan' has an edge connected to the medication node, indicating that it has the ingredient 'olmesartan'.

   5. The patient node is connected to the ingredient node through a 'ALLERGIC_TO' edge, but this connection has an error ('is_error' is 1).

   6. The patient node is also connected to the medication node through a 'TAKES_MEDICATION' edge. This edge indicates that the patient started taking this medication on '1992-10-16T20:51:21Z' and stopped on '1992-10-23T20:51:21Z'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
