Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are two nodes: 'Ingredient' with ID 'fluticasone' and a property 'tau_o' set to 1, and another node 'Medication' with code '895994'. This medication has an 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship pointing to the ingredient. The problem seems to be that both the medication and the ingredient have this 'tau_o' property as 1.

Wait, but looking at the edges, the medication is connected to the ingredient via HAS_INGREDIENT with tau_o=1, which makes sense because medications usually have ingredients. But then, the patient is connected to the medication with TAKES_MEDICATION also having tau_o=0 and an error flag of 1. Hmm.

The inconsistency here might be that both edges (TAKES_MEDICATION and HAS_INGREDIENT) for the medication node have 'tau_o' set incorrectly. Maybe 'tau_o' isn't applicable or should only be on one edge, causing duplication.

So, to fix this, I think we need to remove the 'tau_o' property from both edges connected to the medication node. That way, each relationship has its own tau_o value without conflict.

DEL_EDGE | [takES_MEdICATION] | {tau_o: 0}
DEL_EDGE | [has_INGREDIENT] | {tau_o: 1}
