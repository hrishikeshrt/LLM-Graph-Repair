Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        1. There is a node labeled as 'Ingredient' with the ID 'epoetin alfa'. It has a property 'tau_o' of 1.

   2. There is another node labeled as 'Medication', also with the ID 'epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. Its properties include 'code' (205923), 'description', and 'tau_o' of 1.

   3. A third node represents a patient named Walker122, born on September 6, 1914. The properties for this node include 'address', 'birthdate', 'id', 'first name', 'last name', 'deathdate', and 'tau_o' of 0.

   4. The medication node (epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) has an edge connected to the ingredient node (epoetin alfa). This edge is labeled as 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. It also has a property 'tau_o' of 1 and 'is_error' set to 0.

   5. The patient node (Walker122) has an edge connected to the ingredient node (epoetin alfa), with the label 'ALLERGIC_TO'. This edge has properties including 'tau_o' of 0 and 'is_error' set to 1, indicating an error in the data.

   6. Another edge connects the patient node (Walker122) to the medication node (epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection). This edge is labeled as 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. Its properties include 'start' and 'stop' dates, 'tau_o' of 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
