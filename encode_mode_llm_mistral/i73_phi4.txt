</repairs>
```

Explanation of the repairs:
1. **UPD_NODE**: The patient is marked as deceased, but they are taking medication and have an allergy to it after their death date. This is inconsistent with real-world logic.
2. **DEL_EDGE**: Remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship since it started after the patient's death.
3. **ADD_EDGE**: Create a new `ALLERGIC_TO` edge from the patient to the medication, specifying when the allergy was noted.
