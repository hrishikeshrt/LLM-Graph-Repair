The inconsistency arises from the patient Logan497 taking a medication with code '205923' on April 19, 2005, and being allergic to its ingredient 'oxycodone', but there is no clear relationship between the medication '205923' and the ingredient 'oxycodone'. Additionally, the allergy lacks start and stop dates.

To address these issues:

1. Ensure that the medication with code '205923' has a correct relationship with the ingredient 'oxycodone'.
2. Add missing start and stop dates to the patient's allergy information.
