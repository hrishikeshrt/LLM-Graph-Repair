```xml
<repairs>
    UPD_NODE | p | {is_error: 0}
</repairs>
```

Explanation:
- The inconsistency involves an error flag (`is_error = '1'`) associated with the patient's allergy. This suggests that there is a mistake in how the allergy information is recorded.
- To correct this, we update the node representing the patient to set `is_error` to `0`, indicating that the allergy information is now considered accurate and without error.
