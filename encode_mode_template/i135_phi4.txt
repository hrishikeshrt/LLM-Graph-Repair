This repair operation suggests removing the relationship `[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]` between the patient `Boyd728` and the medication `Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension`. This addresses the inconsistency by ensuring that Boyd728 does not take a medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic.
