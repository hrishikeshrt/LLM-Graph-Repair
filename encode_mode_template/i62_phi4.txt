To address the inconsistency where a patient named Sanford861 takes medication containing an ingredient he is allergic to, we need to remove either the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication or the relationship indicating the allergy. Here are two possible repair options:

Option 1: Remove the "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship.
```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>
```

Option 2: Remove the "ALLERGIC_TO" relationship.
```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>
```

Choose one of these options based on whether it is more appropriate to prevent Sanford861 from taking the medication or to correct his allergy information.
