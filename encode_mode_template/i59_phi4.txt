This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient (Sanford861) and the medication (24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet), as it contains an ingredient (ferrous sulfate) to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that the person is not treated with a medicine containing an allergen they are sensitive to.
