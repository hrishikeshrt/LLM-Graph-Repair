Explanation for the suggested repairs:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medication (rm), as the person should not be taking the current medication.
- Update the properties of the Medicine node to reflect an alternative without oxycodone.
- Add a new relationship between the patient and the updated Medicine node with the correct medication.
