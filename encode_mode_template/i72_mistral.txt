This repair suggests removing the allergy relationship between Walker122 and epoetin alfa (as it should not have been there in the first place), deleting the existing medication relationship since a person allergic to an ingredient should not be taking that medicine, adding a new `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship for Walker122 with the correct medicine, and updating Walker122's `allergies` property to an empty list.
