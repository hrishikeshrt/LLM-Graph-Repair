Explanation: The current graph represents a situation where a patient is taking a medication that contains an allergen. To fix this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship between the patient and the problematic medication (`rm`), create a new medication without the allergen, establish a new relationship between the patient and the new medication, and finally update the ingredient node to have a different ID that is not an allergen for the patient.
