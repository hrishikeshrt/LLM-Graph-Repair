Explanation: The current graph shows that Samatha845 takes a medicine (Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet) which contains an allergen (warfarin). To fix this inconsistency, we should remove the relationship between Samatha845 and the incorrect medication, create a new medication without the allergen, and establish a new relationship between Samatha845 and the corrected medicine.
