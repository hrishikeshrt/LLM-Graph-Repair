This repair suggests removing the allergy to epoetin alfa for the patient Walker122 and deleting the relationship between the patient and the medication. This is because a person should not be allergic to an ingredient that they are taking as medication, so the inconsistency lies in the patient's reported allergy to epoetin alfa (the ingredient of the medication being taken).
