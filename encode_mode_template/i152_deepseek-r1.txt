Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user has a Cypher query that's returning some relationships between patients, medications, and ingredients. The issue is that a patient is taking a medication which contains an ingredient they're allergic to. That doesn't make sense because you shouldn't take a medication with an allergen present in it.

Looking at the example given, the patient (Teddy976) takes "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet". This medication has metformin as an ingredient. But Teddy is allergic to metformin, so this setup should be invalid.

The current graph probably includes all these relationships: p taking m, m containing i, and p being allergic to i. However, having both the [rm] and [ra] edges might not make sense because if p is allergic to i, they shouldn't take a medication that contains i.

So, I think the solution here is to remove the edge where the patient takes the medication. That way, there's no connection between the patient and the medication through the ingredient, which would fix the inconsistency.

I don't think we need to add or change any nodes because all the necessary information is already present. The issue is just the extra edge that shouldn't exist. So, deleting the [rm] relationship should solve it.
