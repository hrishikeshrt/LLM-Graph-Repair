Explanation: The given data has an inconsistency since the patient is allergic to oxycodone (ingredient i) but takes a medicine (m) containing oxycodone. To fix this, we remove the relationship between the medication and the ingredient (`DEL_EDGE | [rc]`) because the current medicine does not seem to be the correct one that the patient is taking. Then, we update the properties of the medication node (`UPD_NODE | [m]`) with a different id and description to ensure it's a different medication.
