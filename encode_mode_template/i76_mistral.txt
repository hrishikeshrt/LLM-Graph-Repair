Explanation: The given data shows that Walker122 is taking a medicine (Epogen) which contains an ingredient (epoetin alfa) of which he is allergic. To fix this inconsistency, we can either remove the allergy relationship or update the medication's dosage to zero, as it should not be administered at all if the patient is allergic to one of its ingredients. Since removing the allergy relationship (ra) seems more appropriate in this case, I chose that option. However, updating the dosage (rm) to 0 UNT also ensures that the medication will not be prescribed again in the future.
