To resolve the inconsistency where a patient named Boyd728 is taking medication Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, which contains an ingredient mestranol to which he is allergic, we need to remove the relationship indicating that Boyd728 takes this specific medication. This can be achieved by deleting the edge between the patient and the medication.
