Okay, so I'm trying to fix this inconsistency in a graph where a patient is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they're allergic to. The query shows two relationships: one from p to i via rm (TAKES_MEDICATION) and another from p to i via ra (ALLERGIC_TO). 

The problem here is that the system allows a person to take a medication containing an allergical ingredient, which isn't correct. So I need to remove this association.

Looking at the allowed operations, I can either delete one of the relationships or both nodes involved. If I delete the ra relationship directly, it would break the allergy link. Alternatively, deleting the rc relationship (which connects the medication to the ingredient) might also solve the issue because then the medication wouldn't be linked to its ingredients.

I think deleting the rm relationship is better because it's a direct association between the patient and the medication they're taking. By removing that, we prevent any conflicts with the allergy information.
