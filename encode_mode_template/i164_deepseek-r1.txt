Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, from the description, there's a person (p) who is taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension. This medication contains an ingredient called mestranol. Now, the person p is allergic to mestranol, which means they shouldn't be taking this medicine because of the allergy. But in the current graph, it seems like these two facts are both present without any conflict.

Looking at the code provided:
- The person takes the medication (rm relationship).
- The medication has an ingredient (rc relationship).
- The person is allergic to that same ingredient (ra relationship).

So, all three relationships exist. But logically, if a person is allergic to an ingredient in their medication, taking that medication should be impossible because it's unsafe.

I think the problem here is that there are two separate edges pointing from p to i: one via rm and another via ra. This duplication might confuse the system or create inconsistency because both relationships exist without any conflict being addressed.

To fix this, I can remove either the ALLERGIC_TO relationship (ra) or the TAKES MEDICATION (rm) relationship so that there's only one edge between p and i. But since the ra relationship is necessary to prevent taking the medication in case of an allergy, it makes more sense to keep ra but not have both rm and ra.

So, I'll delete the rm relationship because if someone is allergic to an ingredient, they shouldn't be taking that medication regardless of whether they took it before. Therefore, removing rm will eliminate the possibility of them being prescribed a dangerous medication due to their allergy.

That way, any future attempt to create a TAKES MEDICATION edge from p to m would automatically fail because there's no longer an ra relationship between p and i. This maintains consistency without duplicating relationships.
