This repair suggests removing the incorrect medication-taking relationship (rm) and updating the allergy relationship (ra) to indicate that Sanford861 is no longer allergic to clopidogrel. It is assumed that the patient's allergy status can be changed in this system, and the change will correctly reflect that they are no longer allergic to this ingredient.
