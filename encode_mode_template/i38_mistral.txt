This repair suggests removing the relationship between Astrid395 and verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet (rm), as they should not be related through TAKES_MEDICATION. Additionally, it updates Astrid395's allergies property to exclude naproxen since she is no longer allergic to that ingredient.
