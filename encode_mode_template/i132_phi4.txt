This repair suggests removing the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient Reyna401 and the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" since it contains an ingredient (metformin) to which Reyna401 is allergic. This ensures that Reyna401 does not take a medication containing an allergen, addressing the inconsistency described.
