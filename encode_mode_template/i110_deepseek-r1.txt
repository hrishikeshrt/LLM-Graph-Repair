Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, a person named Sanford861 is taking Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which contains oxycodone. However, Sanford861 is allergic to oxycodone. This shouldn't happen because if someone takes a medication with an ingredient they're allergic to, it's dangerous.

Looking at the graph structure provided:
- The person (p) has relationships [rm] to the medication (m), [rc] to the ingredient (i), and [ra] to the same ingredient (i). So, both the 'rm' and 'ra' edges point from p to i. That means p is taking a medication that contains an allergen they're allergic to, which is incorrect.

So, I need to fix this by removing these conflicting relationships. The best approach is to delete both [rc] and [ra] edges because they represent the same relationship but are causing inconsistency.

I don't think adding or modifying nodes would help here since the issue isn't with the nodes themselves but their connections. There's no need to change properties either because the information seems accurate; it's just the relationships that are conflicting.

Therefore, I'll suggest deleting both edges [rc] and [ra]. Each deletion will be a separate operation in the output.
