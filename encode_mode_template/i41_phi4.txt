To address the inconsistency where a patient named Moises22 takes medication Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, which contains an ingredient mestranol to which he is allergic, we need to remove either the relationship indicating that Moises22 takes this medication or the ingredient from the medication. Here are two possible repair strategies:

1. **Remove the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship:**

   This approach assumes that Moises22 should not be taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension due to his allergy.

2. **Remove the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship:**

   This approach assumes that mestranol is incorrectly listed as an ingredient of Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, which might be a data entry error.

Choose the repair strategy based on additional context or domain knowledge about the medication and its ingredients.
