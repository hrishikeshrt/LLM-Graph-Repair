      DEL_EDGE | [rc] | {id: 'oxycodone'}
      UPD_NODE | [m] | {description: '-'}
   </repairs>
   To fix the inconsistency, we should remove the relationship between the medication and the incorrect ingredient (DEL_EDGE), as well as update the description of the medicine to an empty string since it is not clear what the actual medicine is without the ingredient information (UPD_NODE). This repair assumes that there exists another correct relationship for the medicine with a different ingredient.
