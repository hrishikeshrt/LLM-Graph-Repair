The suggested repairs involve removing the existing relationship between the patient and the medication (as the person should not be taking this medicine), updating the allergy information for the patient node to remove the incorrect allergen, adding a new medication with no ingredients, establishing a relationship between the new medication and the patient, and finally, creating a new ingredient for the new medication that is allergic to the patient.
