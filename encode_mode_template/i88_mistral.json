To correct the inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship between Walker122 and the medicine (rm), mark the medicine as not taken (dosage: '0'), add an allergy relationship between Walker122 and epoetin alfa, update the ingredient node for the medicine to include epoetin alfa, and finally, mark the medication node with the correct information about its contents.",
