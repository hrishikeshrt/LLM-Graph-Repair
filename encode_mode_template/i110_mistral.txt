   </repairs>

Explanation: The medicine (m) with the description "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" is incorrectly associated with the ingredient "oxycodone". To fix this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship between the Medicine node and the Ingredient node (`DEL_EDGE` operation on [rc]). Additionally, since the medicine's description should include the incorrect ingredient, we update the Medicine node with a corrected description (`UPD_NODE` operation on [m]).
