To fix this, we remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient (`DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -`) since it seems incorrect. Additionally, since the textual description of the medicine does not mention olmesartan, we update the medication node to reflect the correct description (`UPD_NODE | [m] | {description: \"Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG\"}`.",
