To address the inconsistency where a patient named Logan497 is taking medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic, we need to remove either the relationship indicating that Logan497 takes the medication or the relationship indicating that Logan497 is allergic to the ingredient. Since it's generally more appropriate to avoid administering medication with allergens than to change allergy information without medical verification, we will opt to remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship.
