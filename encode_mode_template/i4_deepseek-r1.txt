Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's break down what's happening here.

First, there are two relationships from the patient (p) to an ingredient (i): one is `ra:ALLERGIC_TO` and the other is `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT`. The problem arises because the medicine contains an ingredient that the patient is allergic to. This seems contradictory because if a person is taking a medication with an allergenic ingredient, it should be an issue.

Looking at the query, it's matching both relationships together. So, in reality, each relationship (taking a medication and having an ingredient) should exist separately. But when combined, they create this inconsistency where the same ingredient is both taken and allergic to.

So, I think the solution is to remove one of these relationships so that the contradiction doesn't occur. If we delete either `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT` or `ra:ALLERGIC_TO`, the problem should be resolved because only one relationship will exist between the patient and the ingredient.
