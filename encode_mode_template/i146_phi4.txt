This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient "Samatha845" and the medication "Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG / Olmesartan medoxomil 20 MG Oral Tablet [Tribenzor]" to ensure that Samatha is not treated with a medicine containing an ingredient she is allergic to.
