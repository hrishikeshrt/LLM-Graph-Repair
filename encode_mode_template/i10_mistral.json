To fix this inconsistency, we first remove the relationship between the Medicine and Ingredient node (rc edge), since it appears incorrect. Then, we update the description of the Medicine node (m) to reflect that it contains oxycodone as an ingredient. This updated medicine information should not cause an allergy for the patient (p).",
