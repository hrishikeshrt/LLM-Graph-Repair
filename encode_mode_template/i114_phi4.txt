This repair operation suggests removing the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient `Sanford861` and the medication `1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection`, as it contains an ingredient (`oxycodone`) to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that the person is not treated with a medicine containing an allergen.
