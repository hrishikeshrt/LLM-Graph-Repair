To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove either the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication or the relationship indicating the allergy. Here, removing the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship seems more appropriate to prevent the patient from being treated with the allergen.
