To resolve the inconsistency where a patient, Samantha845, takes medication containing an ingredient she's allergic to, we need to remove either the relationship indicating that she takes the medication or her allergy to the specific ingredient. Here are two possible repair options:

Option 1: Remove the relationship indicating that Samantha takes the medication.
