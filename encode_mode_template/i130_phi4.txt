To resolve the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove either the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication or the allergy relationship. Here are two possible repair strategies:

1. Remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship:
   - This assumes the patient should not take this medication due to their allergy.

2. Remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship:
   - This assumes there was a mistake in recording the allergy, and the patient is not actually allergic to the ingredient.
