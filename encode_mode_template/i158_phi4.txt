This repair operation suggests removing the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient Isiah14 and the medication 24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet, as it contains an ingredient (ferrous sulfate) to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen.
