This repair suggests removing the incorrect relationship between the Medicine and Ingredient node, updating the Patient node to remove the allergy to mestranol, adding a new relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes for the correct allergy, and finally, re-adding the allergy to mestranol in the updated Patient node.
