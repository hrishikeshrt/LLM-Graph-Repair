This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient Cassandra224 and the medication Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet, as it contains an ingredient (chlorthalidone) to which she is allergic. This ensures that Cassandra224 is not treated with a medicine containing an allergen.
