Explanation: The patient is not taking the medication (Oxycodone) as an ingredient. Instead, it should be a prescription for the patient. So we add a new Prescription node and connect it to the Patient and Medication nodes. We also correct the error in the HAS_INGREDIENT edge by setting its 'is_error' property to '0'.
