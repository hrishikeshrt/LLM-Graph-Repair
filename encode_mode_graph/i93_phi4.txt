The inconsistency in the graph involves an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` between a medication and an ingredient, where the properties indicate an error (`is_error: '1'`). This suggests that mestranol is incorrectly listed as an ingredient of Humulin 70/30. To fix this, we should remove the erroneous edge.
