Here's the explanation for the suggested repairs:
- A new Prescription node (p) is added with the correct medication and patient relationships.
- The relationship between the Ingredient (rc) and the Medication (m) is removed, as it seems incorrect.
- The relationship between the Patient (pc) and the Ingredient (rc) is updated to Prescribed_to (pr), indicating that the patient was prescribed the ingredient (now medication).
- The relationship between the Patient (pc) and the Medication (m) is removed, as it seems incorrect.
