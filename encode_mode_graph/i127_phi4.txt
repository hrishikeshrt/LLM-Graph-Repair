The inconsistency arises from the fact that "oxycodone" is labeled as an `Ingredient` but is also associated with a `Medication` node through the `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge, which implies oxycodone should be part of Epogen. However, there's no direct relationship between the patient and oxycodone except via the medication.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship from the patient to oxycodone since it is marked as an error (`is_error: '1'`).

2. Ensure that the patient's relationship with the medication (Epogen) is correctly represented, which seems accurate based on the start and stop dates.

Here are the suggested repairs:

```

This repair removes the incorrect `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between Epogen and oxycodone, addressing the inconsistency.
