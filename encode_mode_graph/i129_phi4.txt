```

Explanation of the repairs:

1. **UPD_NODE**: The node labeled as `Ingredient` with ID `oxycodone` should be updated to a `Medication` since it is an ingredient of another medication (Epogen). This aligns with the context that oxycodone is typically used in medications.

2. **ADD_EDGE**: Add a new edge from the Medication node (`n6846`) to the newly updated Medication node (`n6757`) indicating `HAS_INGREDIENT`. The properties are adjusted to remove the error indication (`is_error: '0'`).

3. **DEL_EDGE**: Remove the existing incorrect edge between the Ingredient node and the original Medication node, as it is now represented correctly by the new edge added in step 2.
