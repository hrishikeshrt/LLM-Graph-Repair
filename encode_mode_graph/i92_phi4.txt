The inconsistency in the graph involves an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` between a medication and an ingredient, marked as erroneous. The error flag (`is_error: '1'`) indicates that this relationship is incorrect.

To resolve this issue:

1. **Delete the erroneous edge**: Remove the `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge because it is incorrectly associating the medication with the ingredient.
