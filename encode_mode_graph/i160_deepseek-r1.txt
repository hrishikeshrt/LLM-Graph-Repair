Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what we have here.

First, there are three nodes with different labels and properties. Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691 is labeled as 'Ingredient' and has a property tau_o of 1, along with an id. Then there's another node with the same identifier but label 'Medication', which includes more detailed properties like code and description. Lastly, another node with the same identifier labeled 'Patient' containing personal info.

Now, looking at the edges: one connects the 'Medication' node to the 'Ingredient' node with a property is_error set to '1'. Another edge connects 'Patient' to 'Medication' with is_error as empty strings. The third edge from 'Patient' to 'Ingredient' has an is_error of '0'.

Hmm, I think the issue here might be that each node (Ingredient, Medication, Patient) should have their own properties without being overwritten by another node's data. So maybe we need to separate these into different nodes.

So, perhaps the first step is to split the 'Medication' and 'Patient' nodes into distinct entities so they don't share the same identifier. That way, each has its unique properties without conflicts.

After that, we can adjust the edges accordingly. The edge from 'Medication' to 'Ingredient' should have an error since it's incorrect, while the edge from 'Patient' to 'Medication' shouldn't have any errors because that data is correct. Also, there's another edge from 'Patient' to 'Ingredient' with no issues.

So, I'll suggest adding new nodes for Medication and Patient if they don't exist yet, then adjusting the edges between them.
