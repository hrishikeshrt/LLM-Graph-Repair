    DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>
```

Explanation of the repairs:
1. The node labeled as `Ingredient` should be a `Medication`, so its label is updated.
2. The edge indicating that the medication has an ingredient (`HAS_INGREDIENT`) is inconsistent because both nodes are now medications. Therefore, this edge is removed.
