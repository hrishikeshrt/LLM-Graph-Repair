Okay, I'm looking at this inconsistency in the graph. So there's a node labeled 'Ingredient' with properties tau_o:1 and id: ferrous sulfate. Then another node for 'Medication' which includes Demerol 50 MG Oral Tablet. There's an edge from Patient to Medication saying takes_medication, starting on 2018-01-03. But there's also an edge from Patient to Ingredient with ALLERGIC_TO, but the properties for that edge are empty except tau_o:0 and is_error:0.

Hmm, wait a minute. If someone is taking Demerol, which is a medication, it shouldn't be an allergen unless specified. But in this case, the edge from Patient to Ingredient has ALLERGIC_TO with no data, meaning there's no actual allergy information attached. That seems off because if a medication is taken, it shouldn't be marked as allergic.

So maybe the issue is that the 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship doesn't have any relevant properties. It should either have an error or some info indicating if taking this medication causes an allergy. Since there's no data here, it might not be correctly set up.

To fix this, I think we need to add some information to the edge so that it reflects whether taking Demerol is associated with an allergy. Maybe adding a 'stop' date would make sense if someone stopped experiencing an allergic reaction after stopping the medication. Alternatively, if there's no relevant data, perhaps setting 'is_error' or another property could be appropriate.

So, I'll suggest adding properties to the edge. Let's say we add 'stop': '2023-01-01T00:00:00Z' as an example, indicating when the allergy was resolved.
