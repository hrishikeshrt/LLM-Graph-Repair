The inconsistency in the graph arises from the relationship between "Medication" and "Ingredient." The medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" should logically contain ferrous sulfate as an ingredient if there is a `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge. However, the current structure does not reflect this correctly due to the presence of an error flag in the properties.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the erroneous `IS_ERROR` property from the `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge.
2. Ensure that the patient's relationship with the medication is accurate and consistent with the data provided.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {'is_error': '-'}
</repairs>

This repair removes the incorrect error flag from the `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge, ensuring the graph accurately represents that ferrous sulfate is an ingredient of the medication. The patient's relationship with both nodes remains unchanged as there are no inconsistencies in those connections based on the provided data.
