This repair suggests adding a new prescription node (p) and connecting it to the medication node (m). The prescription node will have the relevant properties for the medication. Additionally, it removes the incorrect edge between the patient (c) and the ingredient (i), as ferrous sulfate is not an ingredient of the prescribed medication.
