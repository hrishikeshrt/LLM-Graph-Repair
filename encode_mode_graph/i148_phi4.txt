Explanation of Repairs:
1. **UPD_NODE**: The node labeled as `Ingredient` has an incorrect ID 'mestranol', which is actually a medication name, not an ingredient. This should be updated to reflect the correct identity.
2. **DEL_EDGE**: The edge between the `Medication` and `Ingredient` nodes is marked with `is_error: '1'`, indicating it's incorrect or misleading. Removing this erroneous relationship is necessary for accuracy.
