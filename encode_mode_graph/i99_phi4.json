  "content": "The inconsistency in the graph involves a medication (`Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension`) having an ingredient labeled as `mestranol`, which does not align with known formulations of that medication. Additionally, there is an error flag on the HAS_INGREDIENT edge.\n\nTo resolve these issues:\n\n1. Remove the incorrect relationship between the medication and the ingredient.\n2. Address the error flag in the properties of the removed edge.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\nUPD_EDGE | [re] | {'is_error': '0'}\n</repairs> \n\nExplanation:\n- `[rc]` refers to the relationship key `5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51991`, which connects the medication node to the ingredient node.\n- `[re]` refers to updating the error flag on the edge that links the patient to the medication, as it is not erroneous.",
