Explanation: The current graph indicates that the patient is taking a medication (HCTZ) and has an allergy to the same medication, which is inconsistent. To resolve this, we create a new Prescription node and connect it to both the Patient and Medication nodes. We also update the TAKES_MEDICATION edge to reflect the correct start and stop dates.
