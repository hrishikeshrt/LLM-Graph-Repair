The inconsistency in the graph involves a medication (`Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension`) having an ingredient labeled as `mestranol`, which does not align with known formulations of that medication. Additionally, there is an error flag on the HAS_INGREDIENT edge.

To resolve these issues:

1. Remove the incorrect relationship between the medication and the ingredient.
2. Address the error flag in the properties of the removed edge.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
UPD_EDGE | [re] | {'is_error': '0'}
</repairs> 

Explanation:
- `[rc]` refers to the relationship key `5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51991`, which connects the medication node to the ingredient node.
- `[re]` refers to updating the error flag on the edge that links the patient to the medication, as it is not erroneous.
