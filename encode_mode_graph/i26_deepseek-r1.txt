Okay, I'm looking at this inconsistency in the graph. So there are three nodes here: one for the patient, one for medication, and another for ingredients. The edges connect the patient to the medication via ingredient.

Hmm, the problem seems to be with how these nodes are connected. The medications have an 'allergic_to' edge pointing to the ingredient node, but that doesn't make sense because an ingredient can't be allergic; it's the medication that has allergies. So I think we need to reverse that relationship.

Also, the 'takes_medication' edge is correctly pointing from patient to medication, so maybe that part is fine.

So, my plan is to remove the 'allergic_to' edge and create a new edge called 'contains_allergies' instead. That way, it accurately represents that the ingredient has allergies to certain medications.
