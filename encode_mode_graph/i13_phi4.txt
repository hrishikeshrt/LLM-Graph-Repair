The inconsistency in the graph involves an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` between a medication and its ingredient, which has an erroneous property `is_error` set to `'1'`. This suggests that there is an error indicating this relationship should not exist or be incorrect. However, logically, oxycodone can be an ingredient of Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, so the edge itself might not need removal but rather correction.

To address this inconsistency:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {'is_error': '0'}
</repairs> 

This repair operation updates the `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge to correct the erroneous property by setting `is_error` to `'0'`, indicating that there is no error in the relationship.
