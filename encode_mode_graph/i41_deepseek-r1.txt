Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what we have here.

First, there are three nodes involved: Node 4 with different properties. One node is labeled 'Ingredient' and has a tau_o of 1, another is 'Medication' also with tau_o 1, and the third is 'Patient'. The edges connect these nodes in some way.

Looking at the edges:
- There's an edge from the Patient to the Medication (Humulin) with type ALLERGIC_TO. So, the medication is allergic.
- Another edge connects the Patient to the Ingredient (mestranol) with type HAS_INGREDIENT and tau_o 1.
- Then there's another edge between the Patient and the Medication, showing that the patient takes it until a certain date.

Wait, but the 'has_ingredient' property for the ingredient node has tau_o 1. I think tau_o usually stands for version or something, so maybe this is an issue if it's supposed to be null or not present. Maybe we should set tau_o to '-' here because it might not apply anymore.

Also, looking at the ALLERGIC_TO edge between Patient and Medication: it has a 'tau_o' of 0 and 'is_error' as '0'. That seems off because if there's an allergy, maybe this property shouldn't be present or should have a different value. Perhaps we need to remove this edge since it might not make sense in the context.

So the steps would be:
1. Remove the ALLERGIC_TO edge between Patient and Medication.
2. Update the ingredient node to set tau_o to '-' because maybe that property isn't applicable anymore.

That should clean up the graph without any inconsistencies left.
