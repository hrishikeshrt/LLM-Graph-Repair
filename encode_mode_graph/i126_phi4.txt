Explanation:
- The node labeled as `Ingredient` should be a `Medication` since it is associated with another medication and has an ingredient relationship.
- The edge from the patient to the oxycodone node (`ALLERGIC_TO`) seems incorrect because oxycodone is not typically considered an allergen but rather a medication. This edge should be removed.
- A new edge should be added between the `Medication` nodes to indicate that one contains the other as an ingredient, with corrected properties indicating no error.
