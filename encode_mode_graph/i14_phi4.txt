The inconsistency in the graph involves the relationship between the medication and its ingredients. The edge indicates that "Epogen" has an ingredient labeled as "oxycodone," which is factually incorrect since oxycodone is not an ingredient of Epogen.

To correct this, we need to remove the erroneous edge indicating that the medication contains oxycodone as an ingredient.

</repairs> 

Explanation:
- `[rc]` refers to Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846 (Medication: Epogen).
- `[i]` refers to Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757 (Ingredient: oxycodone).
- The edge between these nodes is deleted because it incorrectly states that Epogen contains oxycodone.
