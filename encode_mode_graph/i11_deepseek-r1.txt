Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at what's given.

First, there are three nodes:
- Node 4 with ID e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93
  - Labels: Ingredient
  - Properties: tau_o is 1, id is 'oxycodone'
  
- The same node has another ID e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846
  - Labels: Medication
  - Properties: code is '205923', tau_o is 1, description includes Epogen injection
  
- And another ID e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203
  - Labels: Patient
  - Properties: address, birthdate, etc.

Then there are edges:
- From the patient node to the ingredient with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036
  - Type: HAS_INGREDIENT
  - Properties include is_error as '1'
  
- From the patient to the medication with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:970
  - Type: ALLERGIC_TO
  - Properties have is_error as '0'
  
- From the patient to another medication with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:874
  - Type: TAKES_MEDICATION
  - Properties include start and stop dates

Hmm, the issue here is that a patient node has an edge to itself with type ALLERGIC_TO. That doesn't make sense because a patient can't be allergic to themselves.

So, I think we need to delete this self-edge.
