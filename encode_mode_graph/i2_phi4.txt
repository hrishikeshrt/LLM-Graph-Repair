Based on the provided graph description, there are inconsistencies related to the relationships between nodes. Specifically:

1. The `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge from Medication to Ingredient has a property `is_error: '1'`, indicating an error in this relationship.
2. The `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge suggests that the patient takes a medication with a stop date before their birthdate, which is logically incorrect.

To address these inconsistencies:

- Remove the erroneous `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge between Medication and Ingredient.
- Correct the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship by removing it since it implies an impossible scenario (taking medication before being born).
