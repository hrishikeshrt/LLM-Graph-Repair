The inconsistency in the graph involves a medication node labeled as `Medication` having an edge of type `HAS_INGREDIENT` to an `Ingredient` node, which suggests that the `Medication` itself is an ingredient. This is factually incorrect because medications typically contain ingredients rather than being ingredients themselves.

To correct this inconsistency:

1. Remove the erroneous edge between the `Medication` and `Ingredient`.
2. Add a new edge from the `Medication` to the `Patient`, indicating that the patient takes the medication, if not already present.
3. Ensure the existing edge from the `Patient` to the `Medication` is correct.

Here are the suggested repairs:

Note: The edge from the `Patient` to the `Medication` already exists with correct properties, so no further action is needed for that.
