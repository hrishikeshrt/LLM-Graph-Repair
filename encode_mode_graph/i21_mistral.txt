Explanation: The patient is taking the medication 'Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', but there's no node representing this medication. Therefore, we create a new Medication node with appropriate properties. Additionally, since the TAKES_MEDICATION edge already exists between the Patient and the Ingredient nodes (Oxycodone), we update its start date to match the provided start date in the inconsistent graph.
