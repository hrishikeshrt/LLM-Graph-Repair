The inconsistency in the graph involves the relationship between nodes representing a medication and its ingredient. Specifically, the `Medication` node has an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` to the `Ingredient` node (`oxycodone`). However, the description of the `Medication` node does not mention oxycodone as an ingredient.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the `Medication` and `Ingredient` nodes.
2. Ensure that any error flags are cleared or adjusted if necessary.

Here are the suggested repairs:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
```

This repair removes the erroneous edge indicating that the medication contains oxycodone, which is not supported by its description.
