Explanation of the suggested repairs:
- The edge from Medication to Ingredient is marked as an error (`is_error: '1'`). This should be corrected to `is_error: '0'` assuming no factual error in this relationship.
- Similarly, the edge indicating the patient is allergic to ferrous sulfate is also marked as an error (`is_error: '0'`), which seems correct, but ensuring consistency in marking non-errors with `'0'`.
