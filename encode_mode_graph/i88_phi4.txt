Explanation of Repairs:
1. The node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847` is incorrectly labeled as an 'Ingredient' when it should be a 'Medication'. This is evident from its properties and the edge that connects it to `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846`, which has the type `HAS_INGREDIENT`. The description in node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846` indicates that it is a medication. Therefore, update the label of this node to 'Medication'.
   
2. Delete the edge with type `HAS_INGREDIENT` between nodes `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846` and `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847` because the relationship is incorrect given both nodes represent medications. The edge should not exist as it incorrectly implies that a medication has an ingredient, which in this context refers to another medication.
