The inconsistency in the graph involves the relationship between the `Medication` node and the `Ingredient` node. The edge type `HAS_INGREDIENT` suggests that the medication contains the ingredient, which is factually correct given that oxycodone can be an ingredient in medications like Epogen. However, the property `is_error: '1'` indicates a potential issue with this relationship.

Additionally, there are no apparent inconsistencies with the patient's relationships to the medication and ingredient nodes. The `ALLERGIC_TO` edge has `is_error: '0'`, which suggests it is correctly represented. The `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge also seems appropriate given the timestamps provided.

To resolve the inconsistency, we should focus on correcting the erroneous property in the `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {'is_error': '0'}
