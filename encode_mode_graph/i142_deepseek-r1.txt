Okay, I'm looking at this inconsistency in the graph. There are three nodes and several edges connecting them. The first node has labels 'Ingredient' with a property tau_o:1 and id: olmesartan. Then there's another node labeled 'Medication' connected to it via an edge that says HAS_INGREDIENT, but the medication includes Olmesartan as one of its ingredients. 

Wait, that doesn't make sense because Olmesartan is both a medication and an ingredient within itself? That can't be right. The medication shouldn't have itself as an ingredient. So this edge probably needs to be removed or corrected.

Next, the 'Patient' node has some personal details, but I don't see any direct connection between the Patient and Medication nodes except through the incorrect edge. 

So my first thought is that the edge connecting Medication (with Olmesartan) to Ingredient (Olmesartan) is wrong because a medication can't be its own ingredient. Therefore, removing this edge should fix the inconsistency.

I don't see any other issues in the graph beyond this. The other edges seem correct: the Patient taking the medication and the medication having an allergen.
