Explanation: The patient (pt) is taking a medication (tc), but the Medication node does not exist. We first create a new Prescription node (p) with the given medication details. Then, we update the relationship between the Patient and the newly created Prescription node with correct start date and no stop date. Finally, since there is an incorrect allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient, we remove it (pct).
