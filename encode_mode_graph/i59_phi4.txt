The inconsistency in the provided graph description lies in the relationship between the medication and its ingredient. The edge type `HAS_INGREDIENT` suggests that "ferrous sulfate" is an ingredient of "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet," but this is factually incorrect as ferrous sulfate is not a component of Glucophage (metformin).

To correct this inconsistency, we need to remove the erroneous edge between the medication and the ingredient.
