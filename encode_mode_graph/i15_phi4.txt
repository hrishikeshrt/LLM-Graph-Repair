The inconsistency in the graph involves an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` between a node representing a medication (`Medication`) and a node representing an ingredient (`Ingredient`). The properties of this edge indicate it is erroneous with `'is_error': '1'`. This suggests that the relationship might not be accurate or intended.

To resolve this inconsistency, we should remove the erroneous edge to ensure the graph accurately reflects the relationships between nodes. Here are the suggested repairs:

Explanation of target:
- `[rc]` refers to Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846 (Medication).
- `[i]` refers to Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757 (Ingredient).
