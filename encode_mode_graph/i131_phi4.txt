DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>
```

Explanation of the repairs:

1. **UPD_NODE**: The node representing "metformin" is labeled as an `Ingredient` but should also be a `Medication`, as it is part of the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet." Therefore, we update its labels to include both `Medication` and `Ingredient`.

2. **DEL_EDGE**: The edge indicating that the patient is `ALLERGIC_TO` metformin (`[ra]`) has an incorrect property `is_error: '1'`. Since there's no indication of an allergy in the description, this relationship should be removed to correct the inconsistency.
