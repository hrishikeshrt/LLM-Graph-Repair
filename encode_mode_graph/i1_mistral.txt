   Explanation: The current graph representation suggests that the patient (c) is taking a medication (m) and has an allergy to an ingredient (i) of the same medication. This contradicts the fact that a patient cannot be allergic to their own medication. To fix this, we introduce a new node for the prescription (p), which connects the patient to the correct medication without any allergy association. The error in the original edge connecting the patient to the ingredient is removed.
