Explanation of repairs:
1. The node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847` is labeled as an 'Ingredient' but has properties indicating it's a medication ('epoetin alfa'). Therefore, the label should be updated to 'Medication'.
2. The edge `[rm]` (HAS_INGREDIENT) between `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846` and `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847` is incorrect because both nodes represent the same medication, so this edge should be removed.
