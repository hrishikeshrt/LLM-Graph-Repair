The inconsistency in the graph lies in the relationship between the nodes representing "Medication" and "Ingredient." Specifically, the edge type `HAS_INGREDIENT` suggests that the medication contains naproxen as an ingredient. However, the description of the medication node indicates it is "verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet," which does not match with naproxen.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect edge between the Medication and Ingredient nodes.
2. Update the `is_error` property to reflect that the error has been addressed.

Here are the suggested repairs:

DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {'is_error': '0'}
