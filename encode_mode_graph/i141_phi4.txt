The inconsistency in the graph arises from the relationship between `Medication` and `Ingredient`. The medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" should contain "ferrous sulfate" as an ingredient, but currently, it does not. Additionally, there is a potentially erroneous edge indicating that the patient is allergic to "ferrous sulfate," which seems unrelated to the medication they are taking.

To correct these inconsistencies:

1. Add an `ADD_EDGE` operation between the `Medication` node and the `Ingredient` node to reflect that "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" contains "ferrous sulfate."

2. Remove the erroneous edge indicating the patient is allergic to "ferrous sulfate," as there is no factual basis provided for this relationship.
