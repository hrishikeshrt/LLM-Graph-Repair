The inconsistency in the graph arises from the relationship between the "Medication" node and the "Ingredient" node. The edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` indicates that the medication contains naproxen, but this is incorrect based on the description of the medication ("verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet"). Therefore, the correct repair operation involves removing this erroneous relationship.
