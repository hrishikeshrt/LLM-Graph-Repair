Okay, I'm looking at this inconsistency in the graph. So there are three nodes here: a Patient, a Medication, and an Ingredient. The medication has an ALLERGIC_TO edge pointing to the ingredient with some empty strings for start and stop times. That doesn't make sense because you can't have an allergical relationship without specifying when it starts or stops.

First thought is that maybe the 'ALLERGIC_TO' property should be removed since there's no relevant information. Also, looking at the medication node, its description includes "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" but the ID is just '860975'. That seems incomplete; maybe it should include both ID and description.

So I'll consider removing the 'ALLERGIC_TO' edge because there's no useful data. Then, update the medication node to add the 'description' property with its full details.
