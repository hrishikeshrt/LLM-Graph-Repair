Explanation:
1. The node labeled as `Ingredient` with ID `'mestranol'` is incorrectly associated with the medication `'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension'`. Mestranol is not an ingredient of this medication, so the edge should be removed.
2. No changes are needed for the patient's allergic reaction to mestranol, as it might still be valid based on available information.
