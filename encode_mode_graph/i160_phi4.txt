The inconsistency in the graph involves an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` between a `Medication` node and an `Ingredient` node, with the property `is_error: '1'`. This suggests that there is an error in associating "ferrous sulfate" as an ingredient of "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet." The medication description does not mention ferrous sulfate as an ingredient. Therefore, this edge should be removed to correct the inconsistency.

Additionally, the `is_error` property on this edge indicates a known issue that needs addressing by removing the erroneous relationship.
