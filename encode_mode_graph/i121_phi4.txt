The inconsistency in the graph involves the relationship between the "Medication" node and the "Ingredient" node. The edge type `HAS_INGREDIENT` suggests that oxycodone (an ingredient) is part of Epogen, which is incorrect because Epogen does not contain oxycodone.

To fix this inconsistency:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] -> [ri] | -
</repairs> 

This operation removes the incorrect edge between the "Medication" node and the "Ingredient" node.
