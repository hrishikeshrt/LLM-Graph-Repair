The inconsistency in the graph involves an edge labeled `ALLERGIC_TO` between a patient and an ingredient, which seems factually inaccurate because patients are typically allergic to medications or substances, not ingredients directly. Additionally, there is an error flag set on this edge.

To resolve these inconsistencies:

1. Remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship.
2. Ensure that the `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship remains intact as it correctly associates a medication with its ingredient.

Here are the suggested repairs:
