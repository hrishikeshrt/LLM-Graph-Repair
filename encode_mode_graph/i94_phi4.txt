The inconsistency in the graph involves a medication (`Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension`) having an ingredient (`mestranol`) that does not logically belong to it. Mestranol is typically associated with birth control pills, not insulin formulations like Humulin. Additionally, there's an error flag on the edge indicating this incorrect relationship.

To correct these inconsistencies:

1. Remove the incorrect relationship between `Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension` and `mestranol`.
2. Update the error property of the removed edge to reflect that it has been addressed.
