The inconsistency in the graph involves a patient being marked as allergic to an ingredient that is part of a medication they are taking. This is contradictory because typically, if a patient is allergic to an ingredient, they should not be prescribed a medication containing that ingredient.

To resolve this inconsistency, we can remove the edge indicating the allergy, assuming it was incorrectly marked or needs reevaluation.
