This repair suggests adding a new prescription node (p) and connecting it to the medication (m) with a 'PRESCRIBED' relationship. The medication is also updated to reflect that there is no error associated with it. This should resolve the inconsistency where the same node is both an ingredient and a medication for the patient.
