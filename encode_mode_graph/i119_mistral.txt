Explanation:
- A new Prescription node is added with the correct medication code and description.
- The Medication node's ID is updated to match the one in the prescription.
- The relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes is removed because it seems incorrect (Oxycodone is a medication, not an ingredient).
- A new relationship is added between the Prescription and Medication nodes to indicate that the prescription has this medication.
