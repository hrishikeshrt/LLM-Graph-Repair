The inconsistency in the graph arises from the relationship between "Medication" and "Ingredient." The medication described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" should not have an ingredient labeled as "oxycodone," which is a distinct and unrelated substance. Additionally, there is an error flag set on this edge, indicating a known issue.

To resolve these inconsistencies:

1. Remove the incorrect relationship between the medication and oxycodone.
2. Ensure that any erroneous properties are corrected or removed to reflect accurate information.
