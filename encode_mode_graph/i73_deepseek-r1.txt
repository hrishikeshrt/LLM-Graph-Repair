Okay, so I'm looking at this inconsistency in the graph data. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, there are three nodes involved: a Patient (6465), a Medication (6846), and an Ingredient (6847). The edges connect these nodes with relationships like HAS_INGREDIENT and ALLERGIC_TO.

Wait a minute, the Medication node has both 'tau_o' set to 1, which I think is okay. But the Ingredient also has tau_o:1. Then there's an edge from the Patient to the Medication with the relationship TAKES_MEDICATION, where start and stop dates are given as '1970-05-03T09:30:42Z'. That seems way in the past for someone born in 1914. Also, there's an edge from the Patient to the Ingredient with ALLERGIC_TO, but the start and stop dates are empty.

Hmm, so maybe the problem is that the medication was taken before the patient was born? That doesn't make sense biologically. Also, if the allergy information has no start or end date, it's unclear when this allergy started or ended.

I think I should remove these edges because they don't make logical sense. The TAKES_MEDICATION edge is probably incorrect due to the dates not matching, and the ALLERGIC_TO edge doesn't provide necessary info without valid dates.
