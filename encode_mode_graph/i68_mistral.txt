Here's the explanation for the suggested repairs:

- Add a new node for a prescription with an id.
- Create an edge between the patient and the prescription, indicating that the prescription was made for the patient (PRESCRIBES type).
- Update the existing TAKES_MEDICATION edge to reflect that the medication was started on 1972-10-04T09:30:42Z.
- Remove the existing edge between the patient and the medication, as it is incorrect (the patient does not take this medication).
- Add a new edge between the prescription and the ingredient, indicating that the prescription contains the ingredient (CONTAINS_INGREDIENT type).
