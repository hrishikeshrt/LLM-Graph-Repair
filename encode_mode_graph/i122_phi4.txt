The inconsistency in the graph is that oxycodone, labeled as an `Ingredient`, is incorrectly associated with a medication (`Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection`) through the edge type `HAS_INGREDIENT`. Oxycodone should not be an ingredient of Epogen. Additionally, there's an error flag set on this relationship.

To correct these issues:

1. Remove the incorrect `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge between the medication and oxycodone.
2. Correct the error flag for the remaining edges if necessary (though no additional corrections are specified in the description).

Here are the suggested repairs:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
```

This operation deletes the incorrect edge between the medication and oxycodone, resolving the inconsistency.
