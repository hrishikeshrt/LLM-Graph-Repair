The inconsistency in the graph involves an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` between a `Medication` node and an `Ingredient` node, with the property `is_error: '1'`. This suggests that there is an error associated with this relationship. To correct this factual inconsistency:

- If the `oxycodone` should not be an ingredient of the medication described by the `Medication` node, then the edge indicating this incorrect relationship needs to be removed.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
