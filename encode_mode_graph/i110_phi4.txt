Explanation of the repairs:

1. **UPD_NODE**: The node with ID `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757` is labeled as an 'Ingredient' but has a relationship indicating it is part of a medication (`HAS_INGREDIENT`). This suggests that the node should actually be labeled as 'Medication'.

2. **DEL_EDGE**: The edge from `Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846` to `Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757` is redundant because both nodes represent medications, and the relationship `HAS_INGREDIENT` does not make sense between two medication nodes. Therefore, this edge should be deleted.
