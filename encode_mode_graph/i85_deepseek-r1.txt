Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

Looking at Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847, it has labels as 'Ingredient' and properties like tau_o set to 1. Then there's another node with the same ID but different label 'Medication' and some description about Epogen. Hmm, that seems off because a medication shouldn't be labeled just as 'Medication' without more details.

Wait, so maybe the Medication node is missing important info like the code or description. The edge from Patient to Medication has an issue tooâ€”the stop time is empty. That probably means there's no end date for when the medication was taken. Also, the edge from Patient to Ingredient says 'has_ingredient' but the tau_o is 0, which might mean it's not active.

I think the main problems are:
1. The Medication node lacks necessary properties like code and description.
2. The stop time in that edge isn't set properly.
3. The has_ingredient relationship isn't marked as active since tau_o is 0.

So to fix this, I should probably add those missing properties to the Medication node. Then update the edge's start date and ensure the ingredient relationship is correctly marked with tau_o:1.
