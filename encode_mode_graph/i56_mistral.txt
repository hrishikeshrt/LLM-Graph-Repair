Explanation: The patient (pm) is taking the medication (p), but there is no prescription node (p) in the graph. So, we add a new Prescription node (p). We then update the relationship between the Ingredient (rc) and the newly created Prescription (p) to remove the error flag. Finally, we remove the incorrect relationship between the Patient (pm) and the Medication (M), and create a new one between the Patient (pm) and the Prescription (p).
