Explanation of Repairs:
- The node labeled as `Ingredient` should also be considered a `Medication`, so its labels are updated.
- The relationship indicating the medication has an ingredient is marked as erroneous. It should not have the error flag, so it's corrected by adding a new edge with `is_error` set to '0'.
- The existing erroneous edge is updated to remove the error flag.
