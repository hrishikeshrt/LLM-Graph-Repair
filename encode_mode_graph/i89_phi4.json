This edge should be removed because an allergy would typically apply to medications or substances directly administered, and here it's incorrectly connected to an ingredient.\n- The `is_error: '1'` property on this edge further indicates that there was a recognition of inconsistency during data entry, supporting the decision to remove this relationship.",
