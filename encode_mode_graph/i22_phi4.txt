Explanation:
1. The node labeled as `Ingredient` (`oxycodone`) should actually be part of the medication, so its label is updated to `Medication`.
2. The edge from Medication (6846) to Ingredient (6757) marked with an error (`is_error: '1'`) suggests a misclassification or incorrect relationship; thus, it's removed.
