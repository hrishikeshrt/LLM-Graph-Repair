Explanation of the repairs:

1. **UPD_EDGE**: The edge between `Node 6786` (Medication) and `Node 6776` (Ingredient) has an incorrect property `'is_error': '1'`. This suggests a factual inconsistency, as there is no inherent error in having mestranol as an ingredient of Humulin 70/30. Therefore, the edge should be updated to reflect that it is not erroneous by setting `'is_error': '0'`.

2. **DEL_EDGE**: The edge between `Node 6203` (Patient) and `Node 6776` (Ingredient) labeled as `ALLERGIC_TO` lacks temporal information (`start` and `stop` properties are empty), which is crucial for understanding the context of an allergy claim. Given that there's no supporting evidence or additional context provided about this allergy, it's safer to remove this edge to avoid presenting potentially misleading information.
