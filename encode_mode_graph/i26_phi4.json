Additionally, there is an error flag set on this edge, indicating a known issue.\n\nTo resolve these inconsistencies:\n\n1. Remove the incorrect relationship between the medication and oxycodone.\n2. Ensure that any erroneous properties are corrected or removed to reflect accurate information.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757 | -\n</repairs>\n\n<repairs>\nUPD_EDGE | 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036 | {'is_error': '0'}\n</repairs>",
