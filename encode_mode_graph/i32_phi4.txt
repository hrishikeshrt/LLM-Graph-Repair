Explanation:
1. The node labeled as `Ingredient` (oxycodone) should be a part of the medication rather than being a standalone ingredient entity in this context.
2. Update the node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757 to have the label `Medication`.
3. Delete the edge between the medication and the ingredient, as it is redundant once the ingredient becomes part of the medication entity.
