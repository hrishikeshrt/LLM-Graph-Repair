The inconsistency in the graph arises from the relationship between `Medication` and `Ingredient`. The edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` indicates that `oxycodone` (an `Ingredient`) is part of a medication (`Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection`). However, oxycodone is not typically an ingredient in Epogen. This suggests the relationship might be incorrect.

To address this inconsistency, we should remove the erroneous edge between the `Medication` and `Ingredient`.
