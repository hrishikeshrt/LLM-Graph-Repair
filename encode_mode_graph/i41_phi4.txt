The inconsistency in the graph arises from the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and mestranol, which is an ingredient of a medication. Typically, patients are allergic to medications or their ingredients, not directly to an ingredient without it being part of a medication.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` edge between the patient and the ingredient.
2. Add a new relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to the medication containing mestranol.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
ADD_EDGE | [rm, rmc] | type_: ALLERGIC_TO
</repairs>

Where:
- `[rc]` refers to the edge `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6398 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6776`
- `[rm]` refers to the node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6786`
- `[rmc]` refers to the node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6398`
