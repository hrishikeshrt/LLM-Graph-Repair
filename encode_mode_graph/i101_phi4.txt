The inconsistency in the graph arises from the relationship between `Medication` and `Ingredient`. The edge indicates that `Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension` has an ingredient called `mestranol`, which is factually incorrect. Additionally, there's a property error marked by `is_error: '1'`.

To correct these inconsistencies:

1. Remove the erroneous relationship between the medication and the incorrect ingredient.
2. Correct the error flag on this edge.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {'is_error': '0'}
</repairs> 

Note: The `DEL_EDGE` operation is prioritized to remove the incorrect relationship entirely, and then the error flag is corrected for any remaining relevant edges.
