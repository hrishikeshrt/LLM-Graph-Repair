Explanation of Repairs:
1. **Update Node Label**: The node with ID `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691` is labeled as an 'Ingredient'. However, it is associated with a medication (`24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet`). Therefore, its label should reflect that it is a `MedicationIngredient`.

2. **Delete Incorrect Edge**: The edge between the medication node and the ingredient node has a property `is_error: '1'`, indicating an inconsistency. Removing this edge corrects the relationship issue.
