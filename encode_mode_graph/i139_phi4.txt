The inconsistency in the graph involves a medication node (`verapamil hydrochloride`) incorrectly having an edge indicating it contains `naproxen` as an ingredient. The properties of this edge also suggest an error with `is_error: '1'`. Additionally, there is no direct relationship between the patient and `verapamil hydrochloride`, which may be implied but not explicitly stated.

To resolve these issues:

1. Remove the incorrect edge indicating that `verapamil hydrochloride` has `naproxen` as an ingredient.
2. Ensure that any other necessary relationships are correctly represented, although no additional edges need to be added based on the provided information.

Here are the suggested repairs:
