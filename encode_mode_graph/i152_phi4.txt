    ADD_EDGE | [p2, p0] | type_: TAKES_MEDICATION | properties: {'stop': '1994-07-16T20:06:53Z', 'start': '1994-06-18T20:06:53Z'}  <!-- Correct the patient-medication relationship -->
</repairs>
```

Explanation:
1. The `ALLERGIC_TO` edge between the patient and ingredient is incorrect, as metformin is a medication, not an allergen.
2. Ensure the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship correctly connects the patient to the medication node.
