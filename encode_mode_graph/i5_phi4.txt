The inconsistency in the graph arises from the relationship between `Medication` and `Ingredient`. The edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` indicates that the medication with ID `6694` has an ingredient with ID `6696`, which is labeled as `Exemestane` under `Ingredient`. However, this does not align with the description of the medication (`HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet`) in node `6694`.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect edge between the `Medication` and `Ingredient`.
2. Add a new edge to correctly associate the `Medication` with its actual ingredient, if known.

Assuming we do not have information about the correct ingredient for `HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet`, we will only remove the incorrect association:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
```

This operation deletes the edge between node `6694` (Medication) and node `6696` (Ingredient), resolving the factual inconsistency in the graph.
