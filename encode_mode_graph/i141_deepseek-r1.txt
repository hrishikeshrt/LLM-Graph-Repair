Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what we have here.

First, there are three nodes labeled as Ingredient, Medication, and Patient. Each has some properties. The edges connect these nodes with relationships like HAS_INGREDIENT, ALLERGIC_TO, and TAKES_MEDICATION.

Looking at the edges, I notice something odd. The edge from Patient to Ingredient (5996 -> 6691) is labeled "HAS_INGREDIENT" but has a property 'is_error' set to '1'. That seems off because other edges like ALLERGIC_TO and TAKES_MEDICATION don't have this error flag.

I think the main issue here is that the HAS_INGREDIENT edge incorrectly includes an 'is_error' field, which isn't present in the other relationships. This inconsistency might be causing problems elsewhere, so removing it makes sense.

So, I'll suggest deleting that edge property to fix the inconsistency.
