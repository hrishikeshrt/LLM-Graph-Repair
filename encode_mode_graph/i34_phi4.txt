The inconsistency identified in the graph involves the relationship between the medication "Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" and its ingredient "oxycodone." The edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` suggests that oxycodone is an ingredient of Epogen, which is factually incorrect. Oxycodone is not an ingredient of Epogen.

To correct this inconsistency:

1. Remove the erroneous edge indicating that oxycodone is an ingredient of Epogen.
2. Ensure that any error flags are addressed by removing or updating them as necessary.
