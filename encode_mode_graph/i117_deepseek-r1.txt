Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the nodes and edges provided.

First, there are three nodes:
1. Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757 labeled as 'Ingredient' with properties tau_o:1 and id:oxycodone.
2. The same node but at 6846 is labeled as 'Medication' with code:205923, description:1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, and tau_o:1.
3. Node 5840 at id:3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d is labeled as 'Patient' with various properties.

Then there are three edges:
- From 6846 to 6757, type HAS_INGREDIENT. It has tau_o:1 and is_error:1.
- From 5840 to 6757 via key 985, type ALLERGIC_TO with no errors.
- From 5840 to 6846 via key 163, type TAKES_MEDICATION. Stop date is 2013-12-21.

Wait, the problem might be that a node can't have two labels at once. So either 'Ingredient' or 'Medication', but not both. That's probably incorrect because a medication should be an ingredient as well.

So I need to decide whether to keep 'Ingredient' or 'Medication'. If we remove 'Ingredient', the edge HAS_INGREDIENT would point to nothing, which is bad. Alternatively, if we merge them into one node labeled 'Medication' and adjust the edges accordingly.

But perhaps a better approach is to change the label of 6757 from 'Ingredient' to 'Medication'. That way, the edge remains pointing to it without conflict. Then, the edge HAS_INGREDIENT would correctly point to the medication node.

So I'll suggest deleting the 'Ingredient' node and updating the label of the existing node.

DEL_NODE | 6757 | labels: {'Ingredient'}
