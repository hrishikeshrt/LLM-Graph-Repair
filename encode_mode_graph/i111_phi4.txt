The inconsistency lies in the relationship between the `Medication` node and the `Ingredient` node. The edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` incorrectly connects the `Medication` node to the `Ingredient` node, as medications contain ingredients rather than being an ingredient themselves.

To fix this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect edge connecting the `Medication` node to the `Ingredient` node.
2. Add a new edge from the `Medication` node to the `Ingredient` node with the correct relationship type, such as `CONTAINS_INGREDIENT`.

Here are the suggested repairs:

DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
ADD_EDGE | [rc] -> [r6757] | {type_: CONTAINS_INGREDIENT, properties: {'tau_o': 1}}
