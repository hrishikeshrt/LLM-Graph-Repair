Explanation:
1. The node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847` is labeled as an 'Ingredient' but has properties indicating it's a medication ('epoetin alfa'). Therefore, update its label to 'Medication'.
2. The edge `[rm]` (indicating the relationship between `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846` and `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847`) is labeled as 'HAS_INGREDIENT', which is inconsistent with the corrected label of node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847`. Therefore, delete this edge.
3. The edge `[ra]` (indicating an allergy relationship) has a property 'is_error' set to '1', suggesting it is incorrect. Delete this edge to remove the erroneous information.
