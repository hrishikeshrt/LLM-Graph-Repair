Instead, the relationship between the medication and its ingredient should be maintained.\n\nSuggested repairs:\n\n1. Remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient.\n2. Ensure the correct `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship exists between the medication and the ingredient.\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\n</repairs>\n\n<repairs>\n- | - | -\n</repairs> \n\n(Note: The second operation is a placeholder to indicate no additional changes are needed for the `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge, as it already exists correctly.)",
