The inconsistency in the graph arises from the fact that "oxycodone" is labeled as an `Ingredient` but is connected to a `Medication` node through a `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge. This suggests that oxycodone should actually be part of the medication described by the `Medication` node, rather than being a standalone ingredient.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. The `Ingredient` node for "oxycodone" should be connected to the `Medication` node with an appropriate relationship.
2. The existing edge from `Medication` to `Ingredient` is marked as an error (`is_error: '1'`). This indicates that it might not accurately represent the intended relationship.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] -> [ri] | -
ADD_EDGE | [rm] -> [ri] | type_: CONTAINS_INGREDIENT
UPD_EDGE | [rc] -> [ri] | is_error: '0', type_: HAS_COMPONENT
</repairs>

Explanation of the repairs:
- `DEL_EDGE` removes the erroneous edge from `Medication` to `Ingredient`.
- `ADD_EDGE` establishes a new, correct relationship from `Medication` to `Ingredient` using `CONTAINS_INGREDIENT`.
- `UPD_EDGE` updates the existing incorrect edge to reflect that it represents a component of the medication rather than an ingredient directly. The error flag is cleared (`is_error: '0'`).
