Okay, I'm looking at this inconsistency in the graph. There are three nodes and two edges connecting them. The first node has 'tau_o' set to 1 for both 'mestranol' and 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension'. But wait, that's not possible because a drug can't be both an ingredient and a medication at the same time in this context.

So, I think one of these labels should be removed. Maybe 'tau_o' is only for ingredients or medications, but here it's being used incorrectly on both parts. I'll suggest deleting either 'mestranol' or 'Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension' from the first node to fix this inconsistency.
