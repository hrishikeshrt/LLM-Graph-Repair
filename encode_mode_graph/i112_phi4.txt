Explanation of Repairs:
1. `UPD_NODE` operation is used to change the label of Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757 from 'Ingredient' to 'Medication'. This aligns with the context that oxycodone, being a medication, should be labeled as such.
2. `DEL_EDGE` operation removes the incorrect edge between Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846 (Medication) and Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757 (previously Ingredient, now Medication), as it redundantly represents the same entity.
