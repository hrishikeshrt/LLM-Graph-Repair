The inconsistency in this graph involves an edge marked with `is_error` indicating a potential issue. Specifically, there is an edge of type `HAS_INGREDIENT` between the Medication node and the Ingredient node (`oxycodone`) that has `is_error: '1'`. This suggests that the relationship might be incorrect or mislabeled.

To resolve this inconsistency factually:

1. **Delete the erroneous edge** between the Medication and Ingredient nodes, as it is marked with an error.
2. **Add a new correct edge** if `oxycodone` is indeed an ingredient of the medication described by the Medication node (`Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection`). However, based on typical medical knowledge, oxycodone is not an ingredient in Epogen, which is a form of erythropoietin used to treat anemia.

Given this understanding, the repair operation would be:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] -> [r6757] | -
</repairs> 

This removes the incorrect relationship between the Medication and Ingredient nodes.
