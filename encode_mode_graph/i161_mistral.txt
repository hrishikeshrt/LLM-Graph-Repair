The inconsistency is that the patient (Node 4) is marked as allergic to an ingredient (Node 6691), but it should not be. To fix this, we remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes. However, since the patient does take a medication that contains the ingredient, we update the `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge to indicate that there is no error in this relationship.
