The inconsistency in the graph involves an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` between a `Medication` node and an `Ingredient` node, with the property `is_error: '1'`. This indicates that there is an error associated with this relationship. To resolve this issue factually, we should remove this erroneous edge.
