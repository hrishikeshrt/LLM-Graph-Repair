Explanation:
1. The node labeled as `Ingredient` with ID 'mestranol' is incorrectly linked to a medication that describes "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension." Mestranol is not an ingredient of this medication, so the edge connecting them should be deleted.
2. The node's property 'id' should match its label and description accurately; hence, it was updated for consistency with known facts about mestranol as a standalone entity.
