The inconsistency is that the edge between Patient and Medication has an error flag set to '1', but the edge between Patient and Ingredient does not. To correct this, we update the edge properties between Patient and Medication to remove the error flag and set the time of administration (tau_o) to 1 since it is a medication taken by the patient. This assumes that the medication was indeed taken by the patient, but without more information, we cannot definitively say whether or not it should be marked as an allergy.
