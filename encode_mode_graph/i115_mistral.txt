Explanation: The patient is incorrectly linked to both the ingredient and medication nodes. To fix this inconsistency, we create a new prescription node that connects the patient to the medication. We also correct the error flag on the HAS_INGREDIENT edge. Finally, we remove the links between the patient and the ingredient and medication nodes.
