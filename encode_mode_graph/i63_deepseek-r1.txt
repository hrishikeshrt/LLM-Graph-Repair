Okay, let me try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, looking at the nodes and edges provided, I see that Node 4 has three different labels: 'Ingredient', 'Medication', and 'Patient'. That seems a bit confusing because one node can't be all of those at once.

First, maybe I should combine these into a single label to avoid confusion. Let's say we merge them into just 'Medication' since it's the most specific among them. So, I'll update Node 4 to have only the 'Medication' label and remove the other two labels.

Next, looking at the edges: there's an edge from Patient to Ingredient with a key involving '5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51961' and type 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. But since the Patient node is now merged into Medication, this edge doesn't make sense anymore. So I should delete that edge.

Then, there's an edge from Patient to Ingredient with key '5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:980' and type 'ALLERGIC_TO'. Again, this doesn't fit because now the Patient node is just Medication. So I'll remove that edge too.

Lastly, there's an edge from Patient to Medication with key '4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:475' and type 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. This seems correct because the Patient is now Medication, so this edge should stay.

So in summary, I'll update Node 4 to only be a Medication node, delete the two edges that don't fit anymore, and keep the one that makes sense.
