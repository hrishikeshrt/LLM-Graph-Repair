The inconsistency in this graph arises from a medication node being incorrectly linked to an ingredient node via an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT`. The medication "HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet" should not have "exemestane" as an ingredient. Therefore, the repair involves removing this incorrect relationship.
