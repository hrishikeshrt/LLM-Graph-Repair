The inconsistency in the graph is related to the `Edge 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6786 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6776` having an `is_error` property set to `'1'`, indicating a potential issue with the relationship between the Medication and Ingredient nodes. Additionally, the `tau_o` values for the Edge suggest that it might not be correctly aligned with the current state of knowledge.

To resolve this inconsistency:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {'is_error': '0'}
</repairs>

This operation corrects the error flag on the relationship between the Medication and Ingredient nodes, assuming the relationship is valid. The `tau_o` value is consistent with the current state of knowledge as per the node properties, so no update to that property is necessary.
