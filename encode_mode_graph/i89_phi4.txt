Explanation:
- The patient node (`Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465`) is marked as allergic to `epoetin alfa` (an ingredient, not a medication) which is inconsistent with the typical meaning of "allergic to" in medical contexts. This edge should be removed because an allergy would typically apply to medications or substances directly administered, and here it's incorrectly connected to an ingredient.
- The `is_error: '1'` property on this edge further indicates that there was a recognition of inconsistency during data entry, supporting the decision to remove this relationship.
