Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the nodes and edges provided.

First, there's Node 4 with two different edge relationships: one pointing to 6660 (Ingredient) and another to 6703 (Medication). The edge between 6400 (Patient) and 6660 has a property 'is_error' set to '1', which probably means there's an issue with that relationship. Similarly, the edge from 6400 to 6703 also has 'is_error' as '1'. 

I think the problem here is that both edges are marked as errors, but maybe only one should be. Since a patient can take multiple medications and have multiple ingredients in their medication list, having two separate relationships makes sense. So perhaps we shouldn't delete either edge.

Looking at Node 4 again, it has three labels: 'Ingredient', 'Medication', and 'Patient'. That seems off because each node should typically represent one entity. Maybe the label for this node is incorrect or redundant. If it's meant to be a single node representing something like 'Drug' or 'Medicine', then having multiple labels might cause confusion.

So, I think we need to fix the labels on Node 4. Instead of having three separate labels, it should have one that encompasses all relevant categories. Maybe change its label to 'Drug' and update any properties that were specific to each label. For example, if 'tau_k' was a list before, maybe it's no longer needed or should be adjusted.

Additionally, the edges from Node 4 to both 6660 (Ingredient) and 6703 (Medication) might need their properties checked again. If they're both marked as errors but are correct, we shouldn't remove them. Alternatively, if only one is actually an error, we should fix that specific edge.

In summary, the main issues seem to be:
1. Node 4 has incorrect or redundant labels.
2. The edges from Node 4 might have incorrect 'is_error' properties.

So, I'll suggest updating the label of Node 4 and possibly fixing the edge properties if needed.
