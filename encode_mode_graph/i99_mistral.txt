Explanation:
- A new Medication node is added for the ingredient (mestranol) to correctly represent it as a medication.
- The edge between the Patient and the Ingredient nodes is updated to connect the Patient with the newly created Medication node, removing the error flag.
- The edge between the Patient and the Medication node is deleted since it was incorrectly present.
