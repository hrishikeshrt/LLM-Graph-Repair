The inconsistency identified in the graph involves an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` between a medication and an ingredient, marked with `is_error: '1'`. This indicates that there might be an error in associating ferrous sulfate as an ingredient of the specified medication (24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet). The presence of this error flag suggests that ferrous sulfate is not actually an ingredient of this medication. Therefore, to correct this inconsistency, we should remove the erroneous edge.
