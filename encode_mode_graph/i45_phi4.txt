The inconsistency in the graph arises from the fact that there are two nodes representing "verapamil," one labeled as `Ingredient` and another as `Medication`. The edge connecting these nodes suggests a relationship where the medication has an ingredient, which is logically consistent. However, the patient's allergy to verapamil (an ingredient) does not make sense because patients typically have allergies to medications, not their individual ingredients.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` edge between the patient and the ingredient node.
2. Add a new `ALLERGIC_TO` edge between the patient and the medication node to correctly represent the allergy relationship.

Here are the suggested repairs:
