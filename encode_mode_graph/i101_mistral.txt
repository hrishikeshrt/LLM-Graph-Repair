This repair suggests adding a new Prescription node, linking it to the Medication and Patient nodes through the PRESCRIBES relationship. It also updates the TAKES_MEDICATION edge between the Patient and Medication nodes with the correct start and stop dates. Lastly, it removes the incorrect HAS_INGREDIENT edge between the Medication and Ingredient nodes.
