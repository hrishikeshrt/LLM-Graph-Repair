Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what we've got here.

First, there are three nodes involved: Node 4 with different properties for Ingredient, Medication, and Patient. Then there are edges connecting them. The issue seems to be around the relationships between these nodes.

Looking at the edges:

1. There's an edge from Patient (6203) to Medication (6776) labeled HAS_INGREDIENT. The properties say 'tau_o': 1, which probably means it's valid. But then there's another edge from Patient (6203) to Medication (6776) with label ALLERGIC_TO and properties showing an empty stop and start time.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The HAS_INGREDIENT edge is correct because the medication has an ingredient (mestranol). But the ALLERGIC_TO edge seems off because it's connecting Patient to Medication but with no active dates or info about allergies. That might be causing a conflict or inconsistency.

Maybe this second edge shouldn't exist. If the ALLERGIC_TO edge is unnecessary, removing it could fix the issue.

Also, looking at the medication node (6776), it has 'tau_o': 1 but no 'tau_k' properties. I'm not sure if that's a problem, but perhaps it needs to have those allergy details filled in correctly.

So my plan is to remove the problematic edge and maybe add some necessary properties to the medication node.
