Explanation of repairs:
- The node labeled as `Ingredient` should be updated to `Medication` since it is actually an ingredient in a medication.
- An edge from the `Medication` node to the `Ingredient` node should be added with corrected properties, indicating that the relationship is not erroneous.
- The existing incorrect edge from the `Patient` node to the `Ingredient` node (`ALLERGIC_TO`) should be removed as it does not make sense for a patient to be allergic to an ingredient directly.
