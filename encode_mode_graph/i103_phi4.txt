The inconsistency in the graph arises from the relationship between the `Patient` node and the `Ingredient` node. The edge labeled as `ALLERGIC_TO` connects a patient to an ingredient, which is incorrect because patients should not be directly allergic to ingredients; they are typically allergic to medications that contain those ingredients.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the `Patient` and the `Ingredient`.
2. Ensure that the correct relationships exist: the patient takes a medication, which contains an ingredient.

Here's how you can fix it:

This operation deletes the incorrect edge from the `Patient` node to the `Ingredient` node labeled as `ALLERGIC_TO`. The existing relationships already correctly represent that the patient takes a medication (`TAKES_MEDICATION`) and that the medication has an ingredient (`HAS_INGREDIENT`).
