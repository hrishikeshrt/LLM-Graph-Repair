  "content": "The inconsistency in the graph involves the `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge between the `Medication` node and the `Ingredient` node. The `is_error` property of this edge is set to `'1'`, indicating an error, but no other information suggests why it should be erroneous.\n\nTo resolve this inconsistency factually:\n\n- If the medication indeed contains oxycodone as an ingredient, then the `is_error` property should be corrected.\n- If there's a factual reason that the medication does not contain oxycodone, then the edge itself might need to be removed or corrected with accurate information.\n\nAssuming the medication correctly has oxycodone as an ingredient and the error was mistakenly marked:\n\n<repairs>\nUPD_EDGE | [rc] | {'is_error': '0'}\n</repairs>",
