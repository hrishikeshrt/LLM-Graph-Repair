Okay, I'm looking at this inconsistency in the graph. There are three nodes and several edges connecting them. The first node has labels 'Ingredient' with properties tau_o:1 and id:oxycodone. The second is labeled 'Medication' with code 205923 and description about Epogen. The third is 'Patient' with address, birthdate, etc.

Now, the edges: one connects Ingredient to Medication (6757) with an edge labeled HAS_INGREDIENT. Another connects Patient to Medication via ALLERGIC_TO, but its properties are empty except tau_o and is_error as 0. The third edge connects Patient to Ingredient via TAKES_MEDICATION, with start and stop dates.

Hmm, the issue might be that the medication has an ingredient listed (oxycodone) which isn't in the patient's data. Also, the ALLERGIC_TO relationship doesn't have any info, so it's unclear if there's an allergy. The TAKES_MEDICATION edge seems okay with dates.

So, maybe we should remove the HAS_INGREDIENT edge since the ingredient isn't present in the patient. Then, for the ALLERGIC_TO edge, perhaps set a default or add some example data to show it's used but unknown. That way, the graph remains accurate without errors.
