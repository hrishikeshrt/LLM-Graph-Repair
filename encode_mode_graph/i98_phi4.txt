Explanation:
1. The node labeled as `Medication` (Node 6786) should not have an ingredient relationship with a node labeled as `Ingredient` (Node 6776), since medications are composed of ingredients, not the other way around.
2. Therefore, the edge from Node 6786 to Node 6776 (`HAS_INGREDIENT`) is incorrect and should be removed.
3. The node labeled as `Ingredient` (Node 6776) should not have an `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship with a patient (Node 6408), so that edge is also deleted.
