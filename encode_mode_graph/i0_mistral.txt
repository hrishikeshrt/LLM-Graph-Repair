Explanation: The inconsistency lies in the fact that the same node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6646) is labeled as both an Ingredient and a Medication. To fix this, we need to merge the two nodes into one with labels for both Ingredient and Medication. We also remove the incorrect edges connecting the node to itself ([rc] stands for removing the edge from the node representing the ingredient and [rm] stands for removing the edge from the node representing the medication). The updated node properties are set according to the description provided for the Medication node.
