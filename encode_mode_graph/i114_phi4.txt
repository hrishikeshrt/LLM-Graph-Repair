The inconsistency in the graph arises from the fact that there are two nodes with different labels (`Ingredient` and `Medication`) sharing the same ID, which suggests they should be a single node. Additionally, the edge labeled as `HAS_INGREDIENT` is marked as an error.

To resolve these issues:

1. Merge the two nodes into one by updating properties to reflect both `Ingredient` and `Medication`.
2. Remove the erroneous `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship since it incorrectly connects a medication to its ingredient using the same ID.
3. Ensure that the patient's relationships are correctly maintained without errors.

Here are the suggested repairs:
