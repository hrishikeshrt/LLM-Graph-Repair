Explanation: The patient is taking a medication that has the ingredient 'ferrous sulfate', but there's an error in the relationship between the patient and the medication. To fix this, we need to remove the incorrect relationship (DEL_EDGE) and add the correct one (ADD_EDGE). Since the properties of the new edge are the same as the one that should have been added initially, no changes are needed for those properties.
