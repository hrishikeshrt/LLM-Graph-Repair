The inconsistency in the graph arises from the relationship between "Medication" and "Ingredient." The medication node has a description indicating it contains Epogen, but the ingredient node is labeled as "Oxycodone," which does not match. Additionally, there's an error flag on the edge connecting these nodes.

To address this inconsistency:

1. Correct the ingredient associated with the medication.
2. Remove the erroneous edge between the patient and the incorrect ingredient.
