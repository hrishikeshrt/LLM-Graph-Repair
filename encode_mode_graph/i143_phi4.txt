The inconsistency identified in the graph involves an erroneous `ALLERGIC_TO` edge between a patient and an ingredient, which should not exist as patients are typically allergic to medications or substances, not individual ingredients. The medication node contains multiple ingredients, including Olmesartan.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` edge from the patient to the ingredient.
2. Add a new `ALLERGIC_TO` edge from the patient to the medication, assuming that the allergy is related to the medication as a whole.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6400 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6660 | -
ADD_EDGE | 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6400 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6703 | type_: ALLERGIC_TO, properties: {'tau_o': 1, 'is_error': '0'}
</repairs>
```

These operations correct the relationship by removing the incorrect edge and establishing a more accurate connection between the patient and the medication.
