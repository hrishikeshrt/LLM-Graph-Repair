Explanation: The patient is taking a medication (Medication node) with the code '106892', which is Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension. However, this medication does not have mestranol as an ingredient (Ingredient node). To fix this inconsistency, we remove the existing edges connecting the patient to both the incorrect Medication and Ingredient nodes. Then, we add a new Medication node for mestranol with the correct code and create a new edge between the patient and the newly created Medication node, indicating that the patient takes mestranol as an ingredient.
