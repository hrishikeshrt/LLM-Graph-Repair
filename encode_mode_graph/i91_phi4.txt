The inconsistency in the graph arises from an erroneous edge indicating that a patient (`Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203`) is allergic to an ingredient (`mestranol`, `Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6776`). The edge has a property `is_error` set to `'1'`, suggesting that this relationship is incorrect. Additionally, the medication (`Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension`, `Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6786`) contains `mestranol` as an ingredient, but there is no direct error indication for this relationship.

To correct the inconsistency:

1. Remove the erroneous edge indicating that the patient is allergic to the ingredient.
2. Ensure the medication's ingredient relationship remains intact without errors.
