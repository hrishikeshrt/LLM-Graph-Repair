The inconsistency in the graph arises from the fact that there are two nodes representing different aspects of amoxicillin, one as an `Ingredient` and another as a `Medication`. The edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` connects the `Medication` node to the `Ingredient` node. However, the `Patient` node is incorrectly marked as being allergic to the `Ingredient` node rather than the `Medication` node.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect allergy edge from the `Patient` to the `Ingredient`.
2. Add a new allergy edge from the `Patient` to the `Medication`.
