  "content": "The inconsistency in the graph arises from the relationship between `Medication` and `Ingredient`. The edge indicates that `Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension` has an ingredient called `mestranol`, which is factually incorrect. Additionally, there's a property error marked by `is_error: '1'`.\n\nTo correct these inconsistencies:\n\n1. Remove the erroneous relationship between the medication and the incorrect ingredient.\n2. Correct the error flag on this edge.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\nUPD_EDGE | [rc] | {'is_error': '0'}\n</repairs> \n\nNote: The `DEL_EDGE` operation is prioritized to remove the incorrect relationship entirely, and then the error flag is corrected for any remaining relevant edges.",
