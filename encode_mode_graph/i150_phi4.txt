The inconsistency in the graph arises from the relationship between "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" and "mestranol." Specifically, Humulin 70/30 is a medication used to treat diabetes and does not contain mestranol, which is an ingredient found in some birth control pills. Therefore, the edge indicating that Humulin 70/30 has mestranol as an ingredient should be removed.
