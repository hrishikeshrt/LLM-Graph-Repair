To fix this, we update the properties of the edges involved in these inconsistencies. The patient does not have an allergy to the medication, so we set the 'is_error' property of the ALLERGIC_TO edge to '0'. Additionally, since the medication does not contain oxycodone as its ingredient, we set the 'is_error' property of the HAS_INGREDIENT edge to '0'. Furthermore, since the patient is taking the medication (Medication: TAKES_MEDICATION), we update the 'tau_o' property of this edge to reflect that the patient currently takes the medication.",
