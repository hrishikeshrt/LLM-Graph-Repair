The inconsistency in the graph arises from the fact that "mestranol" is listed as an ingredient of "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which is not accurate. Mestranol is a synthetic estrogen, whereas Humulin 70/30 is a mixture of insulin types used to manage diabetes.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the incorrect edge that links the medication node with the mestranol ingredient node. Here are the suggested repairs:
