The inconsistency in the graph involves the relationship between "Medication" and "Ingredient." The edge `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757` indicates that the medication has an ingredient, which is correct. However, the `is_error` property of this edge is set to `'1'`, suggesting a factual error.

To resolve this inconsistency, we should update the `is_error` property of the edge to reflect that there is no error:

UPD_EDGE | [rc] -> [ri] | {'is_error': '0'}
