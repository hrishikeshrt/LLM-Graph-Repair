Explanation of the repairs:
1. The node with ID `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6695` is labeled as an 'Ingredient' but represents hydrochlorothiazide, which should be a medication. Therefore, update its label to include 'Medication'.
2. The edge indicating the patient `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5641` is allergic to `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6695`, which is now correctly identified as a medication. Since the allergy information is marked with an error (`is_error`: '1'), delete this edge to correct the inconsistency.
