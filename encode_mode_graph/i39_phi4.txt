The inconsistency in the graph involves an edge indicating that a medication contains an ingredient (`mestranol`) which does not match with its description as `Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension`. Additionally, there is an error flag on this edge. The patient's allergy to `mestranol` may also be incorrect given the context of Humulin.

Suggested repairs:

1. Remove the erroneous ingredient relationship from the medication.
2. Update the error status for this edge to reflect that it has been corrected.
