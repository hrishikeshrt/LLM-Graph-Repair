The inconsistency lies in the relationship between the `Medication` node and the `Ingredient` node. The edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` has a property `is_error: '1'`, indicating an error, yet it exists. Additionally, there is no direct connection between the `Patient` and `Medication` nodes that reflects the patient taking this specific medication with ferrous sulfate as an ingredient.

To resolve these issues:

1. Remove the erroneous edge between `Medication` and `Ingredient`.
2. Add a new edge to correctly represent the relationship between the `Patient` and the `Medication`, ensuring it includes the correct ingredient.
