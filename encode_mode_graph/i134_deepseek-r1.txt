Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the nodes and edges provided.

First, there are three nodes:

1. Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6776 with label 'Ingredient' and properties tau_o:1.
2. Node same as above but with label 'Medication' and properties code:106892, description:Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, tau_o:1.
3. Node same as first but labeled 'Patient' with address:698 Lehner Light, birthdate:1911-11-19, etc.

Then there are three edges:

Edge from Patient to Medication has type HAS_INGREDIENT and is_error:1.
Edge from Patient to Ingredient has type ALLERGIC_TO and is_error:0.
Edge from Patient to Medication also has type TAKES MEDICATION with start date 1961-01-08.

Wait, the edge from Patient to Medication appears twice? That's a problem. Also, the edge types are conflicting because one says it's an ingredient and another is medication taken.

So, I think we have duplicate edges between Patient (node) and Medication node. One has type ALLERGIC_TO, which might mean the medication causes an allergy to the ingredient, but also there's a TAKES MEDICATION edge with start date 1961-01-08.

This duplication is causing inconsistency because the same relationship can't have two types at once unless it's intentional. So we need to remove one of these edges or perhaps combine them into one if that makes sense.

Additionally, the edge from Patient to Ingredient has an is_error:1, which might mean it's incorrect, but since the other edge (HAS_INGREDIENT) exists, maybe this one should be removed.

So, I'll suggest deleting both edges. That way, we avoid duplication and keep only the correct relationships.
