This repair suggests adding a new prescription node, establishing a relationship between the patient and the prescription, updating the prescription's properties to include a start date (matching the current medication edge), and updating the prescription-patient relationship's properties to include an end date (indicating that the prescription is still active). This should resolve the inconsistency by correctly representing the medication taken by the patient.
