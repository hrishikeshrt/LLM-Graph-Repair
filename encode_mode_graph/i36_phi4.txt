The inconsistency in the graph involves a patient being marked as allergic to an ingredient (`ALLERGIC_TO`) that is actually part of a medication they take (`TAKES_MEDICATION`). This suggests a factual error in the allergy information. The `is_error` property on the `ALLERGIC_TO` edge indicates this inconsistency.

To resolve this, we should remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient.
