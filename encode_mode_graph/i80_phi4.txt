The inconsistency in the graph is that there is an edge indicating a patient is allergic to an ingredient (`ALLERGIC_TO`) when the relationship should be between a medication and its ingredient. Additionally, the `is_error` property of this incorrect edge is set to '1', which suggests it was already identified as erroneous.

To fix this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` edge between the patient and the ingredient.
2. Add a new edge indicating that the medication contains the ingredient (`CONTAINS_INGREDIENT`).

Here are the suggested repairs:

DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
ADD_EDGE | [rc, ri] | {'type_': 'CONTAINS_INGREDIENT', 'tau_o': 1, 'is_error': '0'}
