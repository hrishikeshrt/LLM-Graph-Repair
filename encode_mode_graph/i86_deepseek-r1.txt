Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846 and Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847. Both have the label 'Medication' but different descriptions. The first node mentions "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" and has a tau_o of 1, while the second just says "tau_o": 1 without any additional info.

Then there's Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465 labeled 'Patient' with a birthdate of '1914-09-06'. That seems really old. Also, the description field is empty except for some other fields like 'first', 'last', etc.

Looking at the edges:
- There's an edge from Patient to 6847 (has ingredient) with a tau_o of 1.
- An edge from Patient to 6846 (medication) with tau_o:0, which might be incorrect since it has some info.
- Another edge from Patient to 6846 via 'takES_MEDICATION' with start and stop dates.

Hmm, the issue seems to be that the Patient node is connected to medication nodes in two different ways. The first edge (has_ingredient) connects to 6847 correctly, but the second edge (medication) has tau_o:0, which might mean it's not applicable or incorrect. Also, the description field for the medication node is missing.

So maybe we should remove the 'medication' edge because it's incorrectly marked with tau_o:0 and also to clean up the Patient node by removing any empty descriptions.
