Explanation: The patient is taking the medication (Metformin) but it seems that there is no relationship between the Patient and Medication nodes. To fix this inconsistency, we need to add a relationship between the Patient node and the Medication node (prescribed_for). Additionally, since the current relationship between the patient and the ingredient is incorrect, we remove the allergy-to edge and update the medication label for the ingredient node.
