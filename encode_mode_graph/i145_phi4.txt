Explanation:
1. The node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6660` is labeled as an "Ingredient" but represents Olmesartan, which is part of a medication (Tribenzor). Therefore, it should also have the label "Medication".
2. The edge indicating that the patient is allergic to Olmesartan (`ALLERGIC_TO`) has `is_error: '1'`, suggesting an error in the data. This edge should be removed as there's no evidence of an allergy in the provided information.
