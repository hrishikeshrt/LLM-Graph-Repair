The inconsistency in the graph arises from the `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge between the `Medication` node and the `Ingredient` node, marked with an error (`is_error: '1'`). The medication "Epogen" is unlikely to have oxycodone as an ingredient. Therefore, this relationship should be removed.

Additionally, there are no other inconsistencies identified in the provided nodes or edges that require correction based on the given information.
