Explanation: The patient (pm) is allergic to Hydrochlorothiazide (the ingredient of the medication taken). The allergy information was incorrect, so we add a new allergy node and edge. We also update the Takes_Medication edge for the patient to reflect that they are currently taking the medication without any specific start date.
