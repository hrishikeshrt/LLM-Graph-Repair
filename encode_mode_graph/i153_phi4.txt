Explanation of Repairs:
1. **Update Node Labels**: The node with ID `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691` is labeled as an 'Ingredient' but is also used in the context of a medication (`24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet`). Therefore, it should be updated to include both 'Ingredient' and 'Medication' labels.
   
2. **Delete Edge**: The edge indicating that `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750` (a medication) has the ingredient `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691` is marked with an error (`is_error: '1'`). This suggests a factual inconsistency, and thus the edge should be removed.
