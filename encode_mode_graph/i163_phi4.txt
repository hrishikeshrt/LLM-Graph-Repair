Explanation of repairs:
1. The node labeled `Ingredient` with the ID `'mestranol'` is incorrectly associated with a medication (`Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension`) through an edge marked as `HAS_INGREDIENT`. Mestranol is not an ingredient in Humulin, which is a type of insulin.
2. The edge between the medication and mestranol should be deleted because it represents a factual inconsistency.

The node ID update ensures that the `Ingredient` node has a correct identifier for future reference or corrections if needed.
