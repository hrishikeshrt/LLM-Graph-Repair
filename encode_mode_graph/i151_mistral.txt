This suggests adding a new prescription node, linking it to the medication and patient nodes, updating the medication description, removing the incorrect allergy edge, and adding a correct ingredient edge. The [p], [m], [i] notations refer to the prescription, medication, and ingredient nodes respectively. The [rm] and [rc] notations in the example outputs refer to the removed medication (rm) and incorrect relationship (rc).
