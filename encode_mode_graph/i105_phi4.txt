The inconsistency in the graph involves an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` between a node representing a medication and another node representing an ingredient, which is flagged as erroneous. The relationship should not exist if oxycodone is not actually an ingredient of the specified medication (Epogen). Additionally, there are properties indicating errors that need correction.

Here's how to address these inconsistencies:

1. **Delete the erroneous edge** between the medication and the ingredient because it incorrectly states that oxycodone is an ingredient of Epogen.
2. **Correct the error flag** on the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship, as there is no indication this should be marked as erroneous.
