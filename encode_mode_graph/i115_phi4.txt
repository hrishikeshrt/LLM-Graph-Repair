The inconsistency arises from the fact that oxycodone, labeled as an "Ingredient," is incorrectly linked to a medication ("Medication") via the `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge. Additionally, there's an error flag set on this relationship (`is_error: '1'`). The patient is also marked as allergic to oxycodone with no error, which seems inconsistent given that oxycodone is part of the medication they take.

To resolve these inconsistencies:

1. Remove the erroneous `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge between the medication and oxycodone.
2. Correct the error flag for the patient's allergy to oxycodone if it should be considered an error due to the inconsistency with them taking the medication containing oxycodone.
