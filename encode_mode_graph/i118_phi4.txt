The inconsistency in the graph involves an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` between a `Medication` node and an `Ingredient` node, with an error flag set to '1'. This suggests that there might be incorrect information about oxycodone being an ingredient of Epogen.

To resolve this inconsistency:

- The edge indicating that Epogen has oxycodone as an ingredient should be removed because it is likely incorrect.
- The `is_error` property on the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship should be set to '1' if there's a known issue with the allergy information, but since it's marked as '0', no change is needed unless additional context indicates otherwise.

Here are the suggested repairs:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
```

Explanation:
- `DEL_EDGE` operation removes the incorrect relationship between Epogen and oxycodone.
- `[rc]` targets the edge with key `5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036`, which is of type `HAS_INGREDIENT`.
- No additional details are necessary for this operation.
