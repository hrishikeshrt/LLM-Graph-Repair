The node with ID `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6660` is labeled as an `Ingredient`, but it represents Olmesartan, which is part of the medication described in node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6703`. Therefore, it should also have a `Medication` label.\n2. The edge labeled as `ALLERGIC_TO` between the patient and Olmesartan is inconsistent since Olmesartan is part of a medication being taken by the patient (as indicated by the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship). This suggests an error, so it should be removed.",
