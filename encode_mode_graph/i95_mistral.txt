Explanation: The current graph shows that the patient is taking a medication (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension) which has an ingredient (mestranol). However, mestranol is incorrectly labeled as an Ingredient instead of a Medication.

To fix this inconsistency, we first create a new node for the correct medication with the same code and description. Then, we add an edge between the patient and the newly created medication indicating it has the ingredient mestranol. Lastly, we remove the incorrect edge connecting the patient to mestranol as an Ingredient.
