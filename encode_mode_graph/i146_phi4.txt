Explanation of Repairs:
1. **UPD_NODE**: The node with ID `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6660` is labeled as an 'Ingredient' but represents "Olmesartan medoxomil 20 MG" which is part of the medication described in Node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6703`. Therefore, it should also be labeled as a 'Medication'.
   
2. **DEL_EDGE**: The edge indicating an allergy (`ALLERGIC_TO`) between the patient and olmesartan is marked with `is_error` property set to `'1'`, suggesting that this relationship might be incorrect or erroneous. Removing this edge resolves the inconsistency.
