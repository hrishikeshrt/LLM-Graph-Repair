To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to sever the relationship between the patient and the medication. Here's how you can do it:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>
```

This operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient (Kendal125) and the medication (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension), ensuring that the patient is no longer taking a medicine they are allergic to.
