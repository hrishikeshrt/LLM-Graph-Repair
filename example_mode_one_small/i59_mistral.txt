    </repairs>
    This repair suggests updating the patient node with the allergy information and removing the existing allergy edge between the patient and the ingredient. The update to the patient node includes adding a new key-value pair "allergies" with the value being an array containing the allergen ("ferrous sulfate"). The removal of the existing allergy edge is done by specifying `-` as the details for the delete operation, since no property changes are needed in this case.
