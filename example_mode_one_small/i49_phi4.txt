This operation removes the relationship between the patient "Terrence276" and the medication "HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet," as it contains an ingredient "exemestane" to which the patient is allergic. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen.
