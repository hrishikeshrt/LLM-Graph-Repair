   This repair suggests removing the allergy relationship between the patient and ingredient, as it appears to be incorrect. The assumption is that Earle679 is no longer allergic to mestranol (the ingredient in Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension). However, if further information suggests that Earle679 should not be taking this medication due to an allergy, a different repair would be necessary.
