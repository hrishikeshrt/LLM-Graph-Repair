To fix this inconsistency, we should remove the allergy relationship between the patient and oxycodone (`UPD_EDGE` operation on `ra` edge). Then, since the medicine description seems correct but incorrectly associated with an allergen, we update the medicine node properties by removing the allergen property (`UPD_NODE` operation on `m` node). Lastly, since the patient should still be taking the medication, we add a new relationship between the patient and the updated medicine (`ADD_EDGE` operation on `rm`).",
