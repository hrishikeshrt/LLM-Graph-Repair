    The first repair operation updates the existing relationship `ra` between the patient node and the ingredient node, removing the allergy information by setting its value to an empty string. The second repair operation adds a new relationship `new_allergy` between the patient node and the ingredient node, indicating that the patient is allergic to oxycodone.
