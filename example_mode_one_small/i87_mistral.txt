    UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {allergen: '-'}
    </repairs>

   Explanation: The inconsistency is that Walker122 is allergic to epoetin alfa, but the allergy relationship needs to be removed because it seems there was a mistake in recording the allergy. Instead, we update the `allergen` property of the relationship [ra] to an empty value, indicating no allergen.
