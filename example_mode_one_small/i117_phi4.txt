Explanation:
- The inconsistency arises because a patient (`p`) who is allergic to an ingredient (`i`) is taking medication (`m`) that contains this allergen.
- To resolve this, the relationship `[TAKES_MEDICATION]` between the patient and the medication should be removed. This ensures the patient does not take medicine containing an allergen they are allergic to.
