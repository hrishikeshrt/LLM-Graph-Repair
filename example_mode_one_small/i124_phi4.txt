To address the inconsistency where a patient named Sanford861 takes medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication. Here's the suggested repair:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>
```

This operation deletes the edge `[TAKES_MEDICATION]` between the patient `Sanford861` and the medication containing `oxycodone`, which resolves the inconsistency of treating a person with a medicine they are allergic to.
