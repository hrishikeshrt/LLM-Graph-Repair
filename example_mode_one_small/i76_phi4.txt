This repair operation removes the relationship indicating that the patient "Walker122" is taking the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," which contains an ingredient to which they are allergic. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring the patient is not treated with a medicine containing an allergen.
