   Explanation: The first repair operation updates the `Patient` node to remove oxycodone from its allergies list. The second repair operation removes the allergy relationship between the patient and ingredient nodes, as a person should not be marked as allergic to an ingredient that they are taking in a medication. The third repair operation updates the `Medication` node to remove oxycodone from its allergen list. This is necessary because the medication should not cause an allergy for the patient if it does not contain that allergen.
