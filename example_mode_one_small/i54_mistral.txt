   The first repair operation updates the `ra` edge for patient Samatha845 and removes the allergic relationship with ingredient warfarin. The second repair operation updates the `i` node for ingredient warfarin, setting its allergen property to true. This indicates that Samatha845 is indeed allergic to warfarin, but not in a way that should prevent her from taking Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet (since it may contain other ingredients).
