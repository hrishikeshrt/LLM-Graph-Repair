Explanation: The person is allergic to oxycodone, but the medicine they are taking contains oxycodone. To fix this inconsistency, we remove the allergy to oxycodone from the patient node, update the Medicine node to include Oxycodone as an ingredient, add a new Ingredient node for Oxycodone, and update the Patient node again to include oxycodone in their allergies.
