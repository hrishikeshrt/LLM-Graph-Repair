This repair suggests modifying the `Patient` node to remove the allergy to epoetin alfa, and then removing the existing allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient. This will correct the inconsistency by ensuring that Walker122 is no longer considered allergic to an ingredient in the medication they are taking.
