Update the ingredient node 'oxycodone' with a new id (to avoid confusion with another ingredient)\n2. Delete the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient 'oxycodone'\n3. Remove the 'HAS_INGREDIENT' relationship from the medicine node\n4. Add a new ingredient node 'epogen'\n5. Establish a 'HAS_INGREDIENT' relationship between the medicine node and the newly added ingredient node 'epogen'\n6. Delete the existing 'TAKES_MEDICATION' relationship between the patient and the medicine\n\nThis repair assumes that the medicine the person is taking (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) does not contain oxycodone as an ingredient, but rather contains epogen.",
