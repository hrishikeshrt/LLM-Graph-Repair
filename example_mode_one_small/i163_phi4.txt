This repair operation removes the relationship indicating that the patient "Kendal125" takes the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which contains an ingredient ("mestranol") to which they are allergic. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient is not treated with a medicine containing an allergen.
