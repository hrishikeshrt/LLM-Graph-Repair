This repair suggests updating the patient node to remove the allergy to epoetin alfa, and then removing the existing allergy edge between the patient and the ingredient. This will correct the inconsistency in the graph by ensuring that Walker122 is no longer allergic to an ingredient found in the medicine he is taking.
