To address the inconsistency where a patient named Boyd728 takes medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic, we need to remove the relationship indicating that Boyd728 takes this specific medication. This ensures the graph reflects that Boyd728 should not be taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension due to their allergy to mestranol.
