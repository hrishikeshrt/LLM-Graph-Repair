      UPD_NODE | (p) | {allergies: filter(x in p.allergies where x != 'epoetin alfa')}

The first repair operation updates the `allergies` property of the patient node (p) to remove the allergy to epoetin alfa. The second repair operation removes the edge connecting the patient (p) and the ingredient (i) with the label `ALLERGIC_TO`. This is because a person should not be marked as allergic to an ingredient that they do not take, and in this case, the patient no longer has the allergy.
