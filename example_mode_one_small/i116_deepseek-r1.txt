Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

From the description, a person named Sanford861 takes Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which contains oxycodone. But he's allergic to oxycodone. That means taking that medication shouldn't be allowed because it has an ingredient he's allergic to.

Looking at the graph query, there are two relationships: rm connects p (Patient) to m (Medication), and rc connects m to i (Ingredient). Also, ra connects p to i, indicating allergy.

The problem is that the medication contains an allergen it shouldn't. So, maybe we need to remove that relationship between m and i because the ingredient isn't allowed for that patient.

So, I think we should delete the edge rc since it's connecting a medication with oxycodone to the person who's allergic. That way, the graph won't show that connection anymore.
