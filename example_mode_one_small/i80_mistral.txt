      DEL_EDGE | [ra] | {nodeId: i.id, value: epoetin alfa}
   </repairs>
   This repair suggests removing the allergy to epoetin alfa for patient Walker122 and deleting the edge between Walker122 and epoetin alfa. The number of operations is minimized as we only need to update one node and delete one edge.
