To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove the relationship that indicates the patient takes this specific medication. Here's the suggested repair:

```xml
<repairs>
    DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>
```

This operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient "Altha90" and the medication containing fluticasone, ensuring that the patient is not treated with a medicine they are allergic to.
