This repair suggests that the patient's allergy information should be updated to reflect that they are allergic to the medicine, not just the ingredient. Additionally, it removes the existing allergy edge between the patient and the ingredient, and creates a new allergy edge between the patient and the medicine (since the medicine contains the allergen).
