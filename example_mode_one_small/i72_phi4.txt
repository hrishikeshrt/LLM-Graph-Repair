This repair operation removes the relationship where the patient "Walker122" takes the medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, thus resolving the inconsistency. The specific edge `[p]-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->[m]` is deleted to ensure compliance with the rule that a person should not be treated with a medicine containing an allergen.
