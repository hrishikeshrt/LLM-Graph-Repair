To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication. Here's the suggested repair:

```xml
<repairs>
    DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -

```

This operation deletes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient (Logan497) and the medication (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection), ensuring that Logan497 is not treated with a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to.
