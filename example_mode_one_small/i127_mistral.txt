      UPD_NODE | (p) | {allergies: filter(x in p.allergies where x != 'oxycodone')}
      DEL_EDGE | [ra] | {node: (i), relationship: (p)-[ra]->(i)}
   </repairs>

This repair operation updates the patient node's allergies property to remove oxycodone and deletes the allergy edge between the patient and ingredient nodes. This will correct the inconsistency where a person is allergic to an ingredient they are taking in their medication.
