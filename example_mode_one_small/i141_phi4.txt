Explanation: The inconsistency arises because the patient Marcellus830 is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this issue factually, we should remove the relationship indicating that Marcellus830 takes the medication containing ferrous sulfate. This ensures compliance with the rule that patients should not be treated with medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.
