      UPD_NODE | (p) | {allergies: filter(x in p.allergies where x != 'oxycodone')}
      DEL_EDGE | [ra] | {node: (i), relationship: (p)-[ra]->(i)}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the patient node to remove oxycodone from its allergies list and deleting the allergy edge between the patient and ingredient nodes. This will correct the inconsistency where a person takes a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to.
