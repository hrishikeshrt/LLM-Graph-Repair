Explanation: The patient Cassandra224 is currently taking a medicine with an allergenic ingredient. To fix this inconsistency, we first remove the existing allergy relationship (DEL_EDGE). Then, we update the patient node to remove the chlorthalidone allergy (UPD_NODE). After that, we create a new medicine node (ADD_EDGE) with a non-allergenic ingredient and connect it to the patient (ADD_EDGE).
