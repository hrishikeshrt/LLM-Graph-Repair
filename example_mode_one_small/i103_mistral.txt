This repair suggests removing the allergy relationship between Christena299 and hydrochlorothiazide, and updating the allergies property of the patient node to reflect that they are no longer allergic to hydrochlorothiazide. This allows for a consistent graph where a person is not treated with a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to.
