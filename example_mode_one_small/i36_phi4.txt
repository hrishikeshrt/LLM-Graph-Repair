To address the inconsistency where a patient named Sanford861 takes medication Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet, which contains an ingredient clopidogrel to which he is allergic, we need to ensure that the relationship indicating the patient takes this medication is removed. This will prevent the graph from incorrectly suggesting that the patient should be treated with a medication they are allergic to.
