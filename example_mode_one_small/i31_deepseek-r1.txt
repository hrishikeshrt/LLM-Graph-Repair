Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, a patient (p) with Logan497 first name is taking Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which contains oxycodone. But p is allergic to oxycodone. That's not allowed because you shouldn't take a medication that has an ingredient you're allergic to.

Looking at the graph query, it matches patients taking medications and checks for allergies between patient and ingredient. The returned result shows this inconsistency: the patient is taking a medication with an allergically equivalent ingredient.

So, I need to correct this by removing the edge that connects the medication to the ingredient because the allergy exists directly on the patient. That way, the system knows Epogen isn't allowed for someone allergic to oxycodone.

I'll use `DEL_EDGE` to remove the [rc] relationship between m and i.
