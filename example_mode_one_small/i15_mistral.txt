Explanation: The current graph shows a patient who is allergic to oxycodone (`[p]-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)`) but also takes a medication that contains oxycodone (`[p]-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i)`). To fix this inconsistency, we should remove the allergy information for oxycodone from the patient (`UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {allergen: '-'}`) and add a new allergy relationship between the patient and oxycodone (`ADD_EDGE | [p] | {allergen: {id: 'oxycodone'}}`). This way, the graph reflects that the patient is not allergic to oxycodone anymore.
