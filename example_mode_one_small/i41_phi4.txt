To resolve the inconsistency where a patient named Moises22 takes a medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic, we need to remove the relationship indicating that Moises22 takes Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension. This can be achieved by deleting the edge representing the "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship between Moises22 and the medication.
