In this case, the allergy information for Samatha845 seems to be incorrect. To fix the inconsistency, we update the allergies property of the Patient node (p) for Samatha845 to indicate that she is not allergic to warfarin, then remove the existing allergy relationship between her and warfarin (ra).
