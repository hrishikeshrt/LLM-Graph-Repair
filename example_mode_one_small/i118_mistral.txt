Explanation: The inconsistency is that the patient Sanford861 (p) is taking a medicine which contains an ingredient he is allergic to. To resolve this, we first remove the allergy relationship between the patient and oxycodone (DEL_EDGE). Then, we update the patient node to remove oxycodone from its list of allergies (UPD_NODE). Since the medicine information seems correct but associated with an incorrect ingredient, we create a new medicine node with the same description but without oxycodone as an ingredient (ADD_NODE and ADD_EDGE). Finally, we modify the original medicine node to remove the relationship with oxycodone (DEL_EDGE) and associate it with the newly created ingredient-free medicine node (UPD_EDGE).
