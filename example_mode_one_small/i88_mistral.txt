      UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {allergen: "-"}
      UPD_NODE | [i] | {id: "epoetin alfa", allergen: "true"}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the `ra` edge (removing the allergy information) and updating the `i` node (marking the ingredient as allergic). The change in the `i` node is necessary because, according to the provided data, it seems that the ingredient should be marked as an allergen for the patient.
