    DEL_EDGE | [ra] | {node1: p, node2: i}
    </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the `Patient` node (p) to remove 'ferrous sulfate' from its allergies list and deleting the existing edge between the `Patient` node and the `Ingredient` node (i). This will fix the inconsistency where a person is taking a medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to.
