```xml
<repairs>
UPD_NODE | p | {first: "Rosio404", allergicToIngredients: {"verapamil": false}}
</repairs>
```

This repair operation suggests updating the `Patient` node for Rosio404 to indicate that they are no longer allergic to verapamil, assuming this is a factual correction based on new information. If removing the medication relationship is more appropriate due to safety concerns, consider:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>
```

This would remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between Rosio404 and verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet. Choose based on the correct factual scenario.
