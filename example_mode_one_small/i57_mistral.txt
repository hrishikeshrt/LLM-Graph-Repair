    </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the `Patient` node to remove the allergy to fluticasone, and deleting the edge between the `Patient` and `Ingredient` nodes for fluticasone. This change should resolve the inconsistency where a person is taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to.
