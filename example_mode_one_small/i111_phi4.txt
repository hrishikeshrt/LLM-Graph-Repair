This repair operation removes the relationship where the patient Sanford861 takes a medication (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) that contains an ingredient (oxycodone) to which they are allergic. This ensures compliance with the rule that a person should not be treated with a medicine containing an allergen.
