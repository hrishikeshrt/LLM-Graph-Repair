   The first repair operation updates the allergies property of the patient node (p) to exclude 'ferrous sulfate' since it seems that Isiah14 is not actually allergic to ferrous sulfate. The second repair operation removes the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient, as the medicine taken does not contain an allergen for Isiah14.
