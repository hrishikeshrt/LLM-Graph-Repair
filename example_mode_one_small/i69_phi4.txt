Explanation:
- The inconsistency arises because a patient (Walker122) is taking a medication (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) that contains an ingredient (epoetin alfa) they are allergic to.
- To resolve this, the relationship `[TAKES_MEDICATION]` between the patient and the medication should be removed. This prevents the patient from being treated with a medicine containing an allergen.
