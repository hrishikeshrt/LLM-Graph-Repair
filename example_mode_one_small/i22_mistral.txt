      UPD_NODE | (i:Ingredient {id: 'oxycodone'}) | {allergens: LOGAN497: false}
   </repairs>

The suggested repair is to update the allergen property for the ingredient node with id 'oxycodone'. The value of the allergen property for Logan497 should be set to false, indicating that he is no longer allergic to this ingredient. This change will resolve the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient (Logan497) is not allergic to an ingredient in the medicine they are taking.
