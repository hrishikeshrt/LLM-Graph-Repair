To address the inconsistency where a patient named Logan497 takes medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to ensure that this relationship does not exist. Here are the suggested graph repair operations:

```xml
<repairs>
    DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

<repairs>
    DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>

<repairs>
    DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>
```

These operations remove the relationships that indicate Logan497 is taking medication containing oxycodone and being allergic to it.
