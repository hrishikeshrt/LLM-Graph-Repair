This repair suggests updating the allergen property of the oxycodone ingredient to exclude Logan497, and then removing the existing allergic-to relationship between Logan497 and oxycodone. This change makes the graph consistent with the requirement that a person should not be allergic to an ingredient in a medication they are taking.
