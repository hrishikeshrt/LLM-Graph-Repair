   UPD_NODE | [i] | {id: "ferrous sulfate"}
   DEL_EDGE | [ra] | {node: [p], relationship: [i]}
   </repairs>
   In this case, the allergy information for the ingredient (ferrous sulfate) seems to be incorrect. To fix the inconsistency, we update the ingredient node with the correct id and remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient.
