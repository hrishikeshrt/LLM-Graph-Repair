This repair suggests removing the allergy to clopidogrel for the patient Sanford861 and deleting the edge between Sanford861 and clopidogrel. This is because a person should not be allergic to an ingredient in a medication they are taking, so the allergy information needs to be corrected. The repair also assumes that the allergy list for the patient is stored as a property called "allergies" with each allergen being a string in a list.
