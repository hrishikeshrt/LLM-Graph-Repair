This repair suggests removing the allergy relationship between Isiah14 and ferrous sulfate, and updating Isiah14's allergies property to remove the entry for ferrous sulfate. This makes the graph consistent with the statement that a person should not be treated with a medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to.
