      UPD_NODE | (p) | {allergies: filter(x in p.allergies where x != 'oxycodone')}
      DEL_EDGE | [ra] | {node: (i), relationship: (p)-[ra]->(i)}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the `allergies` property of the patient node to remove 'oxycodone' and deleting the edge between the patient and ingredient nodes. This will correct the inconsistency where a person is allergic to an ingredient they should not be taking.
