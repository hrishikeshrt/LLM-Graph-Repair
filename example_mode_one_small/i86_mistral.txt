This repair operation suggests modifying the patient node to remove the allergy to epoetin alfa, and then removing the existing allergy edge between the patient and ingredient nodes. This corrects the inconsistency by ensuring that Walker122 is no longer allergic to an ingredient in the medication he takes.
