      UPD_NODE | (p) | {allergies: filter(x in p.allergies where x != 'oxycodone')}
      DEL_EDGE | [ra] | {node: (i), relationship: (p)-[ra]->(i)}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the `Patient` node to remove oxycodone from its allergies list, and then removing the existing allergy edge between the patient and ingredient nodes.
