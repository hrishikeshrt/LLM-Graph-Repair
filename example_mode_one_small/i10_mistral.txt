This repair suggests the following changes:
- Removing the existing allergy relationship between `p` and `i` (as it is incorrect)
- Removing the ingredient node `i` (as it is no longer relevant)
- Adding a new Ingredient node with the correct ID 'oxycodone' and setting its allergen property to true
- Updating the patient node `p` to be allergic to the new Ingredient node `new_i`
