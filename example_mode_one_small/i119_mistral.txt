This repair suggests removing the allergy to oxycodone for the patient Sanford861 and updating the medication such that it no longer appears as a medicine the patient takes. The reasoning is that a person should not be allergic to an ingredient in a medication they are taking, so either the allergy or the medication relationship should be removed. In this case, I chose to remove the allergy since the patient should not have incorrect allergy information.
