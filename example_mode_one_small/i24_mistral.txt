   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the 'allergens' property of the ingredient node 'oxycodone' to remove the allergy information for 'Logan497'. Additionally, it removes the existing 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship between 'p' and 'i'. This should resolve the inconsistency where a person is taking a medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to.
