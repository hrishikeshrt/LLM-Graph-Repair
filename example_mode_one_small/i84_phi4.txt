This repair operation removes the relationship indicating that the patient (Walker122) takes the medication (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection), which contains an ingredient they are allergic to (epoetin alfa). This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring the patient is not treated with a medicine containing an allergen.
