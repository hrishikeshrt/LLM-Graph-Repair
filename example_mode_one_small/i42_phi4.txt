This repair operation removes the relationship where Cassandra224 takes Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet, which contains an ingredient she is allergic to. This ensures that Cassandra224 does not take a medication containing chlorthalidone, adhering to the constraint that patients should not be treated with medications they are allergic to.
