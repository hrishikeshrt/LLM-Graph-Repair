Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, a patient is taking a medication that has an ingredient which they're allergic to. That's not good because it could cause serious reactions.

Looking at the code, there are two relationships: one between the patient and the medication (rm) indicating the medicine is taken by the patient, and another between the patient and the ingredient (ra) showing allergy. The problem here is that both rm and rc (which connects medication to ingredient) exist, but they shouldn't because taking a medication with an allergic ingredient isn't allowed.

I need to decide which relationship to remove. Since the medicine contains the ingredient, if we remove the rc edge, it would mean the medication no longer has the ingredient listed. That makes sense because the patient is allergic to that specific ingredient, so the medication shouldn't have it anyway.

So, I'll suggest deleting the rc relationship between the medication and the ingredient.
