This repair operation removes the relationship where the patient Sanford861 takes the medication Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet, which contains an ingredient (clopidogrel) that he is allergic to. This ensures compliance with the rule that a person should not be treated with a medicine containing an allergen they are sensitive to.
