  "content": "The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, medication, and a patient. The node labeled as \"Ingredient\" (ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757) represents oxycodone. There is another node labeled as \"Medication\" (ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846), which describes a medication called Epogen, specifically 1 mL of Epogen with a concentration of 4000 UNT/ML Injection and has the code '205923'. The third node is labeled as \"Patient\" (ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840), representing Sanford Fritsch, born on June 22, 1923, residing at 935 Rempel Trail.\n\nThere are three edges in the graph. The first edge (ID: 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036) connects the medication node to the ingredient node with a relationship type of HAS_INGREDIENT, indicating that oxycodone is an ingredient in Epogen. This edge has a property 'is_error' set to '1', suggesting there might be an error associated with this connection.\n\nThe second edge (ID: 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:985) connects the patient node to the ingredient node with a relationship type of ALLERGIC_TO, indicating that Sanford Fritsch is allergic to oxycodone. This edge has 'is_error' set to '0', implying no error in this information.\n\nThe third edge (ID: 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:276) connects the patient node to the medication node with a relationship type of TAKES_MEDICATION. It indicates that Sanford Fritsch took Epogen, starting and stopping on July 26, 2012, at 09:55:43 Zulu time. This edge also has 'is_error' set to '0', indicating no error in this information.",
