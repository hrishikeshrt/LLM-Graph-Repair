The medication's description includes information about its concentration and dosage. \n\nThere are also relationships between these nodes: the patient is allergic to the medication (as indicated by the \"ALLERGIC_TO\" edge) and has taken it at some point (indicated by the \"TAKES_MEDICATION\" edge).",
