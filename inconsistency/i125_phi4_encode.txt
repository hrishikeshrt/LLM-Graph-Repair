This edge has a type "ALLERGIC_TO" with no start or stop dates, a 'tau_o' of 0, and an error indicator set to '0'.

3. The edge from the patient (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840) to the medication (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846) indicates that the patient takes '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'.
