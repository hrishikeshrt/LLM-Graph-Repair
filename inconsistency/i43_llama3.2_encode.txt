This graph represents a patient's information. The node labeled [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] has three labels: "Ingredient", "Medication", and "Patient". 

The "Patient" label contains properties such as address, birthdate, and ID, which identify the patient. The "Medication" label contains a code and description for the medication taken by the patient, Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet.

There are three edges connecting this node to other nodes: one edge indicates that the patient is allergic to an ingredient (the key refers to another node with the same ID), another edge shows that the patient takes the medication, and a third edge shows that the patient has taken the medication at certain times.
