The graph consists of three nodes: a Patient, a Medication, and an Ingredient (which is actually a Medication). The Patient has a birthdate in 1911 and a deathdate in 1975. The medication Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension is taken by the Patient starting on January 8, 1961. This medication contains an Ingredient called mestranol. There seems to be a possible error with the ALLERGIC_TO relationship as both start and stop dates are empty.
