In the graph, there is a node labeled as "Ingredient" with an ID of `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6751`, representing metformin. Another node, labeled as "Medication," has an ID of `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750` and describes a 24-hour Glucophage 500 MG extended-release oral tablet with the code '860975'.

An edge connects the "Medication" node to the "Ingredient" node with a type of HAS_INGREDIENT, indicating that metformin is an ingredient in the Glucophage medication. Another edge links the "Patient" node to the "Ingredient" node with a type of ALLERGIC_TO, suggesting that Reyna401 Shanahan202 might be allergic to metformin, although this information is marked as erroneous.

Additionally, there is an edge from the "Patient" node to the "Medication" node with a type of TAKES_MEDICATION. This indicates that Reyna401 Shanahan202 took the Glucophage medication starting on February 3, 2018, and stopped on March 3, 2018.
