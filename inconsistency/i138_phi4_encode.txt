In the graph, there are three nodes and three edges. The first node represents an ingredient labeled as "Ingredient" with an ID of naproxen and a property tau_o value of 1 (Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6655). The second node is a medication labeled as "Medication," identified by the code '897718,' described as verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet, and has a tau_o value of 1 (Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6699). The third node represents a patient labeled as "Patient" with the first name Weldon459, last name Effertz744, born on April 14, 1944, and residing at 356 Kuhn Grove Suite 62. This patient has an ID of 'a708bca4-8fc9-4567-8c22-8b13d44f4f45' and a tau_o value of 0 (Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5588).

There is an edge from the medication node to the ingredient node, indicating that the medication has naproxen as an ingredient. This relationship is labeled as HAS_INGREDIENT and includes properties tau_o of 1 and an error indicator set to '1' (Edge 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6699 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6655).

Another edge connects the patient node to the ingredient node, labeled as ALLERGIC_TO. This relationship has no start or stop dates and a tau_o value of 0, with an error indicator set to '0' (Edge 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5588 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6655).

The final edge links the patient node to the medication node, labeled as TAKES_MEDICATION. This relationship specifies that the patient started taking verapamil hydrochloride on September 12, 2003, and stopped on March 19, 2004. The tau_o value is 0 (Edge 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5588 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6699).
