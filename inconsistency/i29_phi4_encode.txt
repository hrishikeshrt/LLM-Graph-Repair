The graph describes a set of nodes and edges involving an ingredient, medication, and patient. The ingredient node has the ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757` and is labeled as "Ingredient" with properties indicating it is oxycodone (`id`: 'oxycodone') and having a property `tau_o` set to 1.

The medication node has the ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846`, labeled as "Medication", with properties including a code (`code`: '205923'), description ('description': '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'), and `tau_o` set to 1.

The patient node is identified by the ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203`, labeled as "Patient", with properties such as address ('address': '1081 Orn Street'), birthdate ('birthdate': '1913-05-30'), death date ('deathdate': '2009-05-02'), first name ('first': 'Logan497'), last name ('last': 'Brekke496'), and an ID (`id`: 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1'). The property `tau_o` for this node is 0.

There are three edges connecting these nodes:

1. An edge from the medication node to the ingredient node, with a key `5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036`, indicating that the medication has oxycodone as an ingredient (`type_`: HAS_INGREDIENT). This edge includes properties such as `tau_o` set to 1 and an error flag (`is_error`: '1').

2. An edge from the patient node to the ingredient node, with a key `5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:970`, indicating that the patient is allergic to oxycodone (`type_`: ALLERGIC_TO). This edge has properties including `tau_o` set to 0 and an error flag (`is_error`: '0').

3. An edge from the patient node to the medication node, with a key `5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:211`, indicating that the patient takes the medication Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection (`type_`: TAKES_MEDICATION). This edge specifies start and stop dates both as '2002-07-10T23:35:03Z' and `tau_o` set to 0.
