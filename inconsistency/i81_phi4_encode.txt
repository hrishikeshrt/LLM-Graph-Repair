1. An edge from the medication node (Node 6846) to the ingredient node (Node 6847), indicating that the medication has epoetin alfa as an ingredient.
2. An edge from the patient node (Node 6465) to the ingredient node (Node 6847), suggesting that the patient is allergic to epoetin alfa, although this information is marked with an error.
3. Another edge from the patient node (Node 6465) to the medication node (Node 6846), indicating that the patient took the medication Epogen on July 18, 1976, at exactly 09:30:42 UTC, and stopped taking it at the same time.
