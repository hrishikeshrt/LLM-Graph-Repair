Another node, labeled as \"Medication,\" has an ID of `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750` and describes a 24-hour Glucophage 500 MG extended-release oral tablet with the code '860975'. There is also a node labeled as \"Patient\" with an ID of `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5902`, representing a patient named Reyna401 Shanahan202, born on February 26, 1949, residing at 824 Schuppe Gate Unit 70.\n\nAn edge connects the \"Medication\" node to the \"Ingredient\" node with a type of HAS_INGREDIENT, indicating that metformin is an ingredient in the Glucophage medication. Another edge links the \"Patient\" node to the \"Ingredient\" node with a type of ALLERGIC_TO, suggesting that Reyna401 Shanahan202 might be allergic to metformin, although this information is marked as erroneous.\n\nAdditionally, there is an edge from the \"Patient\" node to the \"Medication\" node with a type of TAKES_MEDICATION. This indicates that Reyna401 Shanahan202 took the Glucophage medication starting on February 3, 2018, and stopped on March 3, 2018.",
