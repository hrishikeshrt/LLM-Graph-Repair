  "content": " Node with ID 'b5581477-7033-4586-bc95-da6a508bdab6' is labeled as a Patient. The patient's first name is Rosio404, last name is Bayer639, birthdate is September 5, 1914, and death date is September 5, 2000.\n\n   Another node with the same ID 'b5581474-7033-4586-bc95-da6a508bdab6' has two different labels: Medication and Ingredient. The medication label is associated with the description \"verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet\" and the code '897718'. As an ingredient, it is identified as verapamil.\n\n   There is an edge connecting the Patient node to the Ingredient/Medication node with the type HAS_INGREDIENT. The edge indicates that the patient has verapamil as an ingredient in their medication.\n\n   Another edge connects the Patient node to the Medication node, indicating that the patient takes this medication. Specifically, the patient started taking it on September 5, 1987 and stopped on September 10, 1988.\n\n   There is also an edge connecting the Patient node to the Medication node with type ALLERGIC_TO. However, this edge has an error ('is_error': '1'), so it seems there might be some inconsistency or incorrect information in the data.",
