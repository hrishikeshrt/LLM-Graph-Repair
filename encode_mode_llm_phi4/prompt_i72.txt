Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a patient named Walker122 Kuhic920 (ID: 19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b), who lived at 524 Brekke Dale Suite 9, was born on September 6, 1914, and passed away on March 19, 1977. The patient is connected to a medication identified as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" (code: 205923) through the relationship TAKES_MEDICATION, which started and stopped on April 28, 1967, at 09:30:42Z.

The medication contains an ingredient known as epoetin alfa. This connection is represented by a HAS_INGREDIENT edge between the medication and the ingredient, both marked with tau_o = 1, indicating they are current or relevant in some context.

Additionally, there is an ALLERGIC_TO relationship from the patient to the ingredient epoetin alfa, although this relationship is flagged as erroneous (is_error: '1') and has no specified start or stop dates.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
