Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, medication, and a patient. The node labeled as "Ingredient" (ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757) represents oxycodone. There is another node labeled as "Medication" (ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846), which describes a medication called Epogen, specifically 1 mL of Epogen with a concentration of 4000 UNT/ML Injection and has the code '205923'. The third node is labeled as "Patient" (ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840), representing Sanford Fritsch, born on June 22, 1923, residing at 935 Rempel Trail.

There are three edges in the graph. The first edge (ID: 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036) connects the medication node to the ingredient node with a relationship type of HAS_INGREDIENT, indicating that oxycodone is an ingredient in Epogen. This edge has a property 'is_error' set to '1', suggesting there might be an error associated with this connection.

The second edge (ID: 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:985) connects the patient node to the ingredient node with a relationship type of ALLERGIC_TO, indicating that Sanford Fritsch is allergic to oxycodone. This edge has 'is_error' set to '0', implying no error in this information.

The third edge (ID: 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:276) connects the patient node to the medication node with a relationship type of TAKES_MEDICATION. It indicates that Sanford Fritsch took Epogen, starting and stopping on July 26, 2012, at 09:55:43 Zulu time. This edge also has 'is_error' set to '0', indicating no error in this information.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
