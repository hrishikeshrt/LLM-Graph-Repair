This repair suggests updating the relationship between the Patient and Medication node to indicate that the medication contains an allergen for the patient. Additionally, it removes the existing Allergic To relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes since the patient is not actually allergic to the ingredient (oxydocone) in this case.
