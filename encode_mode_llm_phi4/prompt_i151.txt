Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        There are three nodes in the graph. The first node represents an ingredient with the ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6751` and is labeled as "Ingredient." It has a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and its identifier is "metformin."

The second node, identified by `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750`, represents a medication labeled as "Medication." This node has properties including a code '860975', a description of "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet," and a 'tau_o' value of 1.

The third node, with the ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5947`, is labeled as "Patient." It represents a patient named Teddy976 Cremin516. This node includes properties such as an address at '795 Rogahn Parade Unit 42', a birthdate of May 23, 1942, and a death date on October 14, 1995.

There are three edges connecting these nodes. The first edge connects the medication to its ingredient with a key `5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51960` and is of type "HAS_INGREDIENT." This relationship has properties 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'is_error' marked as '0'.

The second edge indicates an allergy from the patient to the ingredient, with a key `5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:992` and is of type "ALLERGIC_TO." This relationship has properties 'tau_o' set to 0 and 'is_error' marked as '1', with no specified start or stop times.

The third edge shows that the patient takes the medication, identified by a key `5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:834` and is of type "TAKES_MEDICATION." This relationship has a 'tau_o' value of 0, with start and stop times specified as June 18, 1988, at 20:06:53 Zulu time and July 23, 1988, at 20:06:53 Zulu time, respectively.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
