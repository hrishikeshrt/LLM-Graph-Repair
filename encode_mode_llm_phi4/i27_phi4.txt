The inconsistency arises from the fact that Logan Brekke, who has passed away and is allergic to Oxycodone, is taking Epogen, which incorrectly contains Oxycodone as an ingredient. This relationship should not exist due to the allergy.

To address this:

1. Remove the incorrect HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between Epogen and Oxycodone.
2. Correct the `tau_o` value for the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship to reflect that it is no longer an error.
