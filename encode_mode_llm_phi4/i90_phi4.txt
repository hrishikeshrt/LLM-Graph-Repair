The inconsistency in the graph involves the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" having an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT` with the ingredient "mestranol," despite this being flagged as an error (`is_error` set to '1'). This suggests that "mestranol" should not be listed as an ingredient of "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension." Additionally, since Logan Brekke is allergic to "mestranol" and took the medication containing it (as per the graph), this could imply a significant error in patient safety management.

To resolve these inconsistencies:

1. Remove the incorrect `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" and "mestranol."
2. Ensure that any other necessary updates or checks are made to maintain data integrity, but based on the provided information, removing this erroneous edge is the primary action.
