Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are three nodes: Patient (ID 5840), Medication (ID 6846) which is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, and Ingredient (ID 6757) which is oxycodone. There are three edges connecting them.

The first edge connects the medication to the ingredient with 'is_error' set to '1'. That suggests there's an issue here—maybe the medication shouldn't have that ingredient? But wait, the medication is Epogen, which I think is used for something else, not related to oxycodone. So having it as an ingredient might be incorrect.

The second edge connects the patient to the ingredient with 'is_error' 0, meaning no issue here. The patient is allergic to oxycodone, so that's accurate.

The third edge connects the patient to the medication with start and stop times both set to October 15, 2019, at 09:55:43Z, and 'is_error' 0. So the patient is taking Epogen as prescribed, which I'm not sure about because I thought Epogen was for something else.

Putting this together, it seems like the issue might be with the medication node being incorrectly associated with oxycodone. Since Epogen isn't an opioid, having it contain oxycodone could be a problem. So maybe we should remove that edge or correct the ingredient information.

Alternatively, perhaps the medication shouldn't have any ingredients listed because it's not an opioid. If so, removing the first edge would fix the inconsistency where the medication is incorrectly attributed to oxycodone.

I don't see anything wrong with the other edges—the allergy and the prescription both seem accurate based on the given information.
