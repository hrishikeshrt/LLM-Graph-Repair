To fix this inconsistency, we should remove the existing relationship with the incorrect tau_o value (`DEL_EDGE`) and add a new correct relationship without any errors (`ADD_EDGE`). The new relationship should have a tau_o value of 0 to indicate that it is currently accurate. Additionally, since oxycodone is now correctly associated with the medication, we need to remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient (oxycodone) as it no longer holds true (`DEL_EDGE`). To maintain consistency, we should also update the tau_o value of the original incorrect relationship between the medication and its ingredient to -1, indicating that it was previously incorrect.",
