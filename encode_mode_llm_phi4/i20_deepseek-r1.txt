Okay, I need to figure out how to fix the inconsistency described. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The graph has three edges connected to the patient, medication, and ingredient nodes. The issue seems to be with the 'tau_o' properties on these nodes.

Looking at the details:

1. **Medication (Epogen)**: tau_o is 1.
2. **Ingredient (Oxycodone)**: tau_o is 1.
3. **Patient (Logan Brekke496)**: tau_o is 0.

Wait, but 'tau_o' probably represents a time-of-action or something similar. If the medication and ingredient have tau_o=1, that might mean they were used at a specific time, while the patient having tau_o=0 suggests maybe no such event? Or perhaps there's an inconsistency in how these are recorded.

The edges also have their own 'tau_o' properties:

- The medication to ingredient edge has tau_o=1.
- The patient to ingredient edge has tau_o=0.
- The patient to medication edge has tau_o=0.

This could mean that the medication and its ingredient were taken at a certain time, but the patient's allergy or taking event doesn't align with that. Maybe the 'tau_o' on the edges should match the nodes they connect?

Alternatively, perhaps the 'tau_o' for the patient shouldn't be 0 if they took the medication. Or maybe the medication and ingredient having tau_o=1 is conflicting.

I think the main issue might be inconsistent usage of 'tau_o'. Maybe the edges should have their own 'tau_o' values instead of relying on the nodes, or vice versa. Alternatively, perhaps the patient's 'tau_o' shouldn't be 0 if they took the medication.

Another angle: If the allergy edge (tau_o=0) is correct because the patient is allergic, but the taking medication edge also has tau_o=0, which might conflict with the ingredient having a different value. Maybe we need to adjust how these 'tau_o' properties are handled across nodes and edges.

I think the best approach is to remove the 'tau_o' property from all three involved nodes because it's causing inconsistency in the graph.
