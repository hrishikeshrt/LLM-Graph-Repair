Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. Ferrous sulfate (Node ID: 6691) is identified as an ingredient with a property indicating its occurrence (`tau_o`) of 1. A medication known as "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" (Node ID: 6750), has a code '860975' and also shares the same occurrence value (`tau_o` = 1). There is an edge between this medication and ferrous sulfate, indicating that the medication contains ferrous sulfate as an ingredient. However, there's an error noted in this relationship with `is_error` set to '1'.

The patient, Isiah14 Fritsch593 (Node ID: 5589), resides at 690 Stark Vista and was born on January 6, 1951. This patient is connected to ferrous sulfate via an edge labeled as ALLERGIC_TO, with no error (`is_error` = '0') but no specified start or stop date for the allergy.

Additionally, there's a relationship between Isiah14 Fritsch593 and the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" through an edge labeled TAKES_MEDICATION. This indicates that the patient started taking this medication on October 19, 1991, at 06:11:10 UTC and stopped on November 23, 1991, at 06:11:10 UTC, with no error in this record (`is_error` = '0').

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
