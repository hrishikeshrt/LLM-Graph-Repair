The inconsistency identified involves the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" having "mestranol" as an ingredient, which is marked with an error (`is_error: '1'`). This suggests that "mestranol" should not be listed as an ingredient for this medication. Additionally, Valrie Mertz is allergic to "mestranol," but she also takes "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which incorrectly lists "mestranol" as an ingredient.

To resolve these inconsistencies:

1. Remove the erroneous relationship between the medication and the ingredient.
2. Ensure that any necessary updates or corrections are made to reflect accurate data.
