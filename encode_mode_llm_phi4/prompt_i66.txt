Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph consists of three nodes and three edges. Node 6847 is labeled as an "Ingredient" with the property `id` set to "epoetin alfa." Node 6846 is labeled as a "Medication," having properties such as `code` ("205923"), `description` ("1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection"), and `tau_o` (1). Node 6465 represents a "Patient" with the name Walker122 Kuhic920, born on September 6, 1914, residing at 524 Brekke Dale Suite 9. This patient passed away on March 19, 1977.

There is an edge from node 6846 to node 6847 of type "HAS_INGREDIENT," indicating that the medication contains epoetin alfa as its ingredient. Another edge connects node 6465 to node 6847 with the type "ALLERGIC_TO," suggesting the patient has an allergy to epoetin alfa, although this is marked as an error (`is_error` set to '1'). Finally, there is an edge from node 6465 to node 6846 of type "TAKES_MEDICATION," indicating that the patient was taking the medication Epogen on June 18, 1975.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
