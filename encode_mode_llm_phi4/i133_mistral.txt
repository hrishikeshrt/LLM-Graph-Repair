Explanation: The current graph has an inconsistency where the medication Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension is marked as having mestranol as an ingredient (indicated by edge rc), but it is also marked as an error for this relationship. To resolve this, we can update the tau_o property of mestranol to 0 (since it seems there might be a confusion with another ingredient) and add a new ingredient for Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension with a tau_o of 1. This will ensure that the medication has an accurate list of ingredients without any errors.
