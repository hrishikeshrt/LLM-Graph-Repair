Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The node identified as [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691] is labeled as an 'Ingredient' with the name "ferrous sulfate". Another node, [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750], represents a 'Medication', specifically described as "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" and has a code of "860975". The third node, [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840], is labeled as 'Patient' with the name Sanford Fritsch, born on June 22, 1923. This patient resides at 935 Rempel Trail.

The edges define relationships between these nodes:

1. There is an edge from the medication node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750] to the ingredient node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691], indicating that the medication "HAS_INGREDIENT" ferrous sulfate. This relationship is marked with an error.

2. The patient node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840] has an edge to the ingredient node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691], indicating that the patient is "ALLERGIC_TO" ferrous sulfate. This relationship does not have any error.

3. Additionally, there is an edge from the patient node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840] to the medication node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750], indicating that the patient "TAKES_MEDICATION" 24 HR Glucophage. The duration of this relationship is from April 22, 2011, to May 13, 2011, and it does not have any error.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
