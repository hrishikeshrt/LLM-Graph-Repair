Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a scenario involving a medication, an ingredient, and a patient. The node labeled as "Medication" represents a 24-hour Glucophage 500 MG extended-release oral tablet with the code 860975. This medication contains Metformin, which is represented by the node labeled as "Ingredient." A patient named Reyna401 Shanahan202 resides at 824 Schuppe Gate Unit 70 and was born on February 26, 1949. The graph indicates that this patient takes the Glucophage tablet from April 8, 2017, to May 13, 2017. Additionally, there is an indication of an allergy to Metformin for this patient; however, it is marked as erroneous in the data.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
