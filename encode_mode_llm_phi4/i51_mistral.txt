      The patient, Samantha Mueller, is noted as being allergic to warfarin. However, there are no specific start or stop dates for this allergy and it is marked with an error indication. To fix the inconsistency, we remove the allergy relationship (ra) from Samantha to warfarin. Additionally, since warfarin is causing an allergy for Samantha, we update the allergen property of the warfarin ingredient node to include 'Samantha Mueller'.
