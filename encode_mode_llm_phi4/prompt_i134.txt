Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient identified as "mestranol" is associated with the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which has the code '106892' and is described as such. This relationship is marked by an edge labeled HAS_INGREDIENT, indicating that mestranol is an ingredient of Humulin 70/30.

The patient, named Boyd728 Beahan375, was born on November 19, 1911, at 698 Lehner Light, and passed away on November 3, 1975. There are two key relationships involving this patient: 

1. The patient is allergic to mestranol, as indicated by an edge labeled ALLERGIC_TO connecting the patient node to the ingredient node. This allergy does not have specified start or stop dates.

2. The patient was taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension from January 8, 1961, until February 19, 1961, as shown by a TAKES_MEDICATION edge linking the patient to the medication node.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
