Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents three nodes and three edges. 

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847] is labeled as an "Ingredient" with properties indicating it has an ID of 'epoetin alfa' and a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] is labeled as "Medication," having a code '205923', a description of '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection,' and a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465] is labeled as "Patient" with properties including an address at '524 Brekke Dale Suite 9', a birthdate on '1914-09-06', no tau_k, last name 'Kuhic920', first name 'Walker122', a death date of '1977-03-19', and an ID of '19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b'. The property 'tau_o' is set to 0.

There are three edges:

1. An edge from Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] (Medication) to Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847] (Ingredient), labeled as "HAS_INGREDIENT," with properties 'tau_o' set to 1 and 'is_error' marked as '0'.

2. An edge from Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465] (Patient) to Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847] (Ingredient), labeled as "ALLERGIC_TO," with properties 'tau_o' set to 0, no start or stop dates, and 'is_error' marked as '1'.

3. An edge from Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465] (Patient) to Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] (Medication), labeled as "TAKES_MEDICATION," with a start and stop date of '1971-06-09T09:30:42Z' and property 'tau_o' set to 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
