The inconsistency in this scenario is that the patient, Walker122 Kuhic920, is both taking a medication and allergic to one of its ingredients. This situation suggests either an error in recording the allergy or a need for additional context (e.g., the allergy might not be relevant during the time they were taking the medication).

To address this inconsistency factually:

1. **Add a temporal constraint** to the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship, indicating that the allergy is irrelevant during the period when the patient was taking the medication.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {start_date: "1974-09-03T09:30:42", end_date: "1977-03-19T00:00:00"}
</repairs>

This repair assumes that the allergy is not relevant during the time the patient was taking the medication, effectively making it inactive for that period.
