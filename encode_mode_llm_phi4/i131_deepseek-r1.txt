Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, there's a node for "Patient" connected to an "Ingredient" called metformin via an ALLERGIC_TO relationship. But actually, the medication taken is Glucophage 500 MG extended-release, which contains metformin as one of its ingredients. So the patient isn't allergic to metformin; they're taking it.

Looking at the graph query, there are two edges from the Patient node: one to Medication (TAKES_MEDICATION) and another to Ingredient (ALLERGIC_TO). The problem is with the ALLERGIC_TO edge because it's incorrect. Metformin is in the medication, so the allergy shouldn't be marked.

I need to remove that incorrect edge. So the operation would be to delete the relationship between Patient and Ingredient via the ALLERGIC_TO type.
