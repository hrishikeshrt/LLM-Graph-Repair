        The graph describes a scenario involving a patient, a medication, and an ingredient. The patient, identified by ID [cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1] with the name Logan Brekke, was born on May 30, 1913, lived at 1081 Orn Street, and passed away on May 2, 2009. The medication in question is described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" with a code of '205923'. This medication contains an ingredient identified by ID [oxycodone], which has the label 'Ingredient'. 

The patient has an allergy to oxycodone, indicated by the edge labeled 'ALLERGIC_TO', and there are no time constraints specified for this allergy. Additionally, the patient was taking the medication Epogen from January 10, 2000, at 23:35:03 UTC until the same date and time, as denoted by the edge labeled 'TAKES_MEDICATION'. The medication contains oxycodone, which is indicated by the edge labeled 'HAS_INGREDIENT', but there's an error associated with this relationship.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
