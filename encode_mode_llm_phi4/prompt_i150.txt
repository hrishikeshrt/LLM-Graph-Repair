Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The node with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6776] represents the ingredient "mestranol." Another node, [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6786], is labeled as a medication named "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" with code '106892.' The third node, [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6012], represents the patient Valrie Mertz, who resides at 939 Gutmann Alley and was born on May 26, 1981.

There is an edge from the medication node to the ingredient node, indicating that "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" has "mestranol" as an ingredient. This relationship is marked by a type labeled HAS_INGREDIENT and includes properties indicating it may contain errors (is_error: '1').

Additionally, there are two edges connecting the patient node to both the ingredient and medication nodes. The first edge from the patient to the ingredient signifies that Valrie Mertz is allergic to "mestranol," with no start or stop dates provided for this allergy, and it is marked as having no errors (is_error: '0'). 

The second edge connects the patient node to the medication node, indicating that Valrie Mertz takes "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension." This relationship includes a start date of August 13, 2019, at 11:09 AM and a stop date of September 17, 2019, at 11:09 AM, with no errors indicated (is_error: '0').

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
