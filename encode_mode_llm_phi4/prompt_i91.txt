Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is identified as mestranol (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6776), which is part of the medication Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6786). The patient, Logan Brekke496 (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203), has an address at 1081 Orn Street and was born on May 30, 1913. Logan passed away on May 2, 2009.

The medication Humulin 70/30 contains mestranol as an ingredient, indicated by the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship with a timestamp (tau_o) of 1 and marked as erroneous ('is_error': '1').

Logan Brekke496 is allergic to mestranol, as shown by the ALLERGIC_TO relationship, which has no specific start or stop times and is not marked as erroneous ('is_error': '0').

Additionally, Logan took Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension from June 8, 1990, at 23:35:03 UTC to October 5, 1990, at 23:35:03 UTC, indicated by the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship with a timestamp (tau_o) of 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
