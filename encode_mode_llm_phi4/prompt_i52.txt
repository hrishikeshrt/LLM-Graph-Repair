        The graph consists of three nodes and three edges. 

Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6698 is labeled as an "Ingredient" and represents the substance warfarin, with a property tau_o set to 1.

Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6697 is labeled as a "Medication" and describes Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet. It has properties including code '855332', description, tau_o set to 1, and an error status of '0'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
