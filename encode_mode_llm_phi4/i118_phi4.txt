The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the patient taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic. Specifically, the patient Sanford861 Fritsch593 takes Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which contains oxycodone as an ingredient, and the patient is also allergic to oxycodone.

To resolve this inconsistency while maintaining factual accuracy:

1. The relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication should be removed since it is unsafe for a patient with an allergy to take a medication containing that allergen.
