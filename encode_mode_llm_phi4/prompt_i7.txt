        The graph describes a scenario involving a patient, a medication, and an ingredient. The patient, Earle679 Frami345 (ID: 3acf9313-1874-4dff-ab2a-3187516d92d6), was born on May 7, 1917, lived at 208 Kilback Center Unit 20, and passed away on January 23, 2018. This patient is allergic to an ingredient named exemestane (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93). Additionally, the patient took a medication called HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet (code: 310798), which contains exemestane as an ingredient. The relationship between the medication and the ingredient is marked by a property indicating an error in data.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
