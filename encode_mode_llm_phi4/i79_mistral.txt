Explanation: The current graph indicates that the patient is allergic to "epoetin alfa", but the medication labeled as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" contains this ingredient. To fix this inconsistency, we should update the 'tau_o' property of the ingredient node 'i' to 0 (since it is not an allergen for the patient). Then, we add a new edge between the ingredient node and the medication node with a unique key 'rc2'. This new edge will represent that the medication contains another ingredient, which is factually accurate.
