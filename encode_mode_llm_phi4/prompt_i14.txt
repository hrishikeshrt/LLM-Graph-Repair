Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph consists of three nodes and three edges. The first node is an ingredient labeled "oxycodone" with the ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757]. The second node represents a medication described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," identified by the code '205923' and labeled "Medication" with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846]. The third node is a patient named Logan Brekke, who was born on May 30, 1913, and passed away on May 2, 2009. This patient's address is "1081 Orn Street," and the ID is [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203].

The graph includes three edges indicating relationships between these nodes. The first edge connects the medication node to the ingredient node, labeled as "HAS_INGREDIENT" with a property indicating an error ("is_error": '1'). The second edge links the patient node to the ingredient node, showing that the patient is allergic to oxycodone, marked by the type "ALLERGIC_TO," and no errors are indicated. Lastly, there's an edge from the patient node to the medication node with the type "TAKES_MEDICATION," indicating that Logan Brekke took Epogen starting and stopping on April 19, 2005, at 23:35:03 UTC, without any error reported.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
