        The graph describes a medication-related scenario involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. 

1. **Ingredient Node**: There is an ingredient identified by the ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847`, labeled as "Ingredient," with properties indicating it is epoetin alfa (`id`: 'epoetin alfa') and has a timestamp value of 1 (`tau_o`: 1).

2. **Medication Node**: There is a medication identified by the ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846`, labeled as "Medication," with properties including a code '205923', a description of '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', and a timestamp value of 1 (`tau_o`: 1).

3. **Patient Node**: There is a patient identified by the ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465`, labeled as "Patient," with properties such as an address '524 Brekke Dale Suite 9', birthdate '1914-09-06', deathdate '1977-03-19', first name 'Walker122', last name 'Kuhic920', and a timestamp value of 0 (`tau_o`: 0).

The edges describe relationships between these nodes:

1. **HAS_INGREDIENT Edge**: The medication `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846` has the ingredient `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847`, with a timestamp value of 1 (`tau_o`: 1) and no error (`is_error`: '0').

2. **ALLERGIC_TO Edge**: The patient `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465` is allergic to the ingredient `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847`, with a timestamp value of 0 (`tau_o`: 0) and an error present (`is_error`: '1').

3. **TAKES_MEDICATION Edge**: The patient `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465` takes the medication `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846`, with both start and stop times on '1973-03-30T09:30:42Z' and a timestamp value of 0 (`tau_o`: 0).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
