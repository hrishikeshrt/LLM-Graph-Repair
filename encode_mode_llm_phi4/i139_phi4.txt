Explanation of Suggested Repair:
- The inconsistency lies in the `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the medication and naproxen being marked with an error (`is_error: '1'`). Since it is factually correct that verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet contains naproxen as an ingredient, we should update this edge to remove the erroneous flag. The repair operation `UPD_EDGE` is used to modify the property of the relationship by setting `is_error` to `'0'`.
