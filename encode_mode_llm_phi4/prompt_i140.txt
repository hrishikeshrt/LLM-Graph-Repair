Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph consists of three nodes and three edges. Node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691) represents an ingredient labeled as "Ingredient," specifically identified as ferrous sulfate, with a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

Node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750) is labeled as "Medication" and describes a medication known as "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet," with properties including a code '860975' and 'tau_o' set to 1.

Node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5996) represents a patient labeled as "Patient" named Marcellus Lemke830, born on May 23, 1942. The patient's address is 170 Kerluke Extension Suite 51, and the property 'tau_o' is set to 0.

There are three edges connecting these nodes:

1. An edge from node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750) to node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691), indicating that the medication contains ferrous sulfate as an ingredient. This edge has a type 'HAS_INGREDIENT' and properties including 'tau_o' set to 1, with 'is_error' marked as '1'.

2. An edge from node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5996) to node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691), indicating that the patient is allergic to ferrous sulfate. This edge has a type 'ALLERGIC_TO' with properties including 'tau_o' set to 0 and 'is_error' marked as '0'.

3. An edge from node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5996) to node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750), indicating that the patient takes the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet." This edge has a type 'TAKES_MEDICATION' with properties including start and stop dates for taking the medication, 'tau_o' set to 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
