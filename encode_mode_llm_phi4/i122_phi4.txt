The inconsistency described suggests that there is an error with the inclusion of "oxycodone" as an ingredient in the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection." Since the patient, Sanford Fritsch861, is allergic to oxycodone and takes this medication, it implies that the medication should not contain oxycodone. Therefore, the relationship between the medication and the ingredient needs correction.
