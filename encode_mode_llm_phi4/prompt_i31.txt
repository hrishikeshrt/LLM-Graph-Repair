Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a scenario involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. 

1. The node labeled as "Ingredient" with ID `[4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757]` represents oxycodone.

2. The node labeled as "Medication" with ID `[4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846]` describes a medication called Epogen, specifically 1 mL of Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, identified by the code `205923`.

3. The node labeled as "Patient" with ID `[4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203]` represents a patient named Logan Brekke, born on May 30, 1913, and deceased on May 2, 2009. The patient's address is 1081 Orn Street.

The edges describe relationships between these nodes:

4. There is an edge from the "Medication" node to the "Ingredient" node with a type labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT`, indicating that oxycodone is an ingredient in Epogen. This relationship has an error flag set as `'is_error': '1'`.

5. Another edge connects the "Patient" node to the "Ingredient" node, indicating that Logan Brekke is allergic to oxycodone. This relationship does not have any start or stop dates and is marked with `'is_error': '0'`, suggesting no error.

6. Finally, there is an edge from the "Patient" node to the "Medication" node of type `TAKES_MEDICATION`. This indicates that Logan Brekke took Epogen starting and stopping on September 18, 2008, at 23:35:03 UTC, with no errors noted in this relationship.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
