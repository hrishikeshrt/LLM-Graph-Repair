        The graph describes a medical scenario involving a patient, medications, and ingredients. There is an ingredient identified as Naproxen ([Node ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6655]), which is part of a medication called Verapamil Hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet ([Node ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6699]). The patient, Weldon459 Effertz744 ([Node ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5588]), is allergic to Naproxen and has taken Verapamil Hydrochloride between March 13, 1998, and May 8, 1998. The medication contains Naproxen as an ingredient, but there is an error associated with this relationship.
