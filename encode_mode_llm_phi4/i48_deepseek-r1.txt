Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this graph inconsistency. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, there's a patient named Terrence276 Goodwin327 who is allergic to exemestane and also has taken HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet, which contains exemestane as an ingredient. But both of these relationships have errors. 

Looking at the graph structure: The patient (p) takes a medication (m), which has an ingredient (i). There's another relationship where the patient is allergic to an ingredient (exemestane).

So, the issue here seems to be that the same ingredient (exemestane) is being shown both as an allergy and as part of a medication. That doesn't make sense because if someone is allergic to something, it shouldn't be present in their medication.

I think the problem arises from having two separate edges connecting the patient to the ingredient: one for allergy and another for being an ingredient. These should probably be merged into a single edge so that the allergy isn't incorrectly linked to the medication's ingredients.

So, I need to remove both existing relationships between the patient and exemestaneâ€”one for the allergy and one for the ingredient. That way, only one relationship remains, which would logically be the allergy since it's more critical or correct in this context.
