Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        The graph describes a medication system involving a patient and a specific drug. The node representing the ingredient "clopidogrel" is linked to the node for the medication "Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet," which contains this ingredient, as indicated by the edge labeled HAS_INGREDIENT.

A patient named Sanford861 Fritsch593, residing at 935 Rempel Trail and born on June 22, 1923, is associated with both the medication and the ingredient. The patient has a history of taking Plavix from April 22, 2005, to May 6, 2005, as indicated by the edge labeled TAKES_MEDICATION.

Additionally, there is an indication that the patient is allergic to clopidogrel, although this information is marked with an error flag. This relationship is represented by the edge labeled ALLERGIC_TO.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.

</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
