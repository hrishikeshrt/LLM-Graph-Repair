The first repair operation updates the edge between the patient and medication (rm) to remove the error flag, indicating that Logan Brekke496 indeed took Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. The second repair operation deletes the edge between the patient and ingredient (ra), as it is incorrect for a patient who has taken a specific medication to also be allergic to an ingredient of that medication.
