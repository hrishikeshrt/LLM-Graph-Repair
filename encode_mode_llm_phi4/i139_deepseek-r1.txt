Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this graph inconsistency. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, there's a patient who took a medication called verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet from July 20, 2001, until August 24, 2001. The medication has an ingredient naproxen, but the relationship between the medication and naproxen is marked as an error (is_error: '1'). Also, the patient has an allergy to naproxen.

So, looking at the graph structure:

- The patient (Node 5588) takes verapamil (Medication node with code 897718).
- Verapamil contains naproxen as an ingredient.
- The patient is allergic to naproxen.

But since verapamil doesn't contain naproxen, the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between them is incorrect. This is why it's marked as an error.

I need to correct this without affecting other parts of the graph. The simplest fix would be to remove the erroneous edge so that the medication no longer lists naproxen as an ingredient. That should eliminate the inconsistency because the medication won't incorrectly include a drug it doesn't have.

The HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between the medication and naproxen is incorrect since the medication does not contain naproxen.
