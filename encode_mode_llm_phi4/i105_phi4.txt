The inconsistency arises from the fact that the patient, who is allergic to oxycodone, is also taking a medication that contains oxycodone as an ingredient. This situation should be flagged or corrected in the graph.

To address this issue:

1. Update the edge indicating the patient takes the medication to reflect the potential error due to the allergy.
2. Correct the `is_error` property on the "HAS_INGREDIENT" relationship if it is incorrectly marked as '1'.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rm] | tau_o=1, is_error='1'
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | is_error='0'
</repairs>
