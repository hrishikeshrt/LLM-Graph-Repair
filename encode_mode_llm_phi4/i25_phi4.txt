The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves the relationship between the medication Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection and its ingredient Oxycodone. The `tau_o` value for this relationship is set to 1, but there is an error flag indicated as '1', suggesting a factual inconsistency.

To resolve this issue, we need to correct the erroneous relationship by removing it, given that Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection does not actually contain Oxycodone. This will ensure that the graph accurately reflects the real-world data.
