Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is identified as "mestranol" (Node ID: [6776]). It has a property `tau_o` set to 1.

A medication named "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" (Node ID: [6786]) contains this ingredient "mestranol." This relationship is represented by an edge labeled as HAS_INGREDIENT, with properties indicating `tau_o` is 1 and `is_error` is '1'. The key for this edge is [51991].

A patient named Earle679 Frami345 (Node ID: [6408]) has specific details such as a birthdate of May 7, 1917, an address at "208 Kilback Center Unit 20," and a death date on January 23, 2018. The patient is allergic to the ingredient "mestranol." This relationship is represented by an edge labeled ALLERGIC_TO with properties `tau_o` set to 0 and `is_error` as '0'. The key for this edge is [983].

Additionally, the same patient takes the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" from July 18, 1994, to October 10, 1994. This relationship is represented by an edge labeled TAKES_MEDICATION with properties `tau_o` set to 0 and a key of [73].

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
