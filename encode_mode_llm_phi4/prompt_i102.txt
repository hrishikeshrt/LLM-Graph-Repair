Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is identified by the ID `mestranol` with properties indicating its presence (`tau_o`: 1). A medication named "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" has the code '106892', also marked as present (`tau_o`: 1), and includes mestranol as one of its ingredients, indicated by an edge labeled `HAS_INGREDIENT`. The patient, Earle679 Frami345, with ID `3acf9313-1874-4dff-ab2a-3187516d92d6`, lived at '208 Kilback Center Unit 20' and was born on May 7, 1917. This patient is allergic to mestranol, as shown by an edge labeled `ALLERGIC_TO`. Additionally, the patient took "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" from February 1, 2016, to February 29, 2016, indicated by a `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
