Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        The graph describes a scenario involving three entities: an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient identified as "oxycodone" (Node ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757) is part of the medication labeled "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" (Node ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846). The patient, named Sanford Fritsch861 with an address at 935 Rempel Trail and a birthdate of June 22, 1923 (Node ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840), is allergic to oxycodone. Additionally, the patient takes the medication Epogen as per records starting and stopping on June 27, 2017, at 09:55:43 Zulu time. There is an error associated with the ingredient's inclusion in the medication.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
