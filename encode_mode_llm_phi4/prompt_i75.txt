Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        RETURN *
        The graph describes a medication system involving an ingredient and a patient. There is an "Ingredient" node identified as epoetin alfa (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847). This ingredient is part of the "Medication" node, which is described as 1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection with a code of 205923 (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846). The medication includes epoetin alfa as an ingredient, indicated by the HAS_INGREDIENT edge.

There is also a "Patient" node representing Walker122 Kuhic920 (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465). This patient has an allergy to epoetin alfa, as shown by the ALLERGIC_TO edge. However, this relationship is marked with an error. Additionally, Walker122 Kuhic920 took the medication 1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection starting and stopping on July 27, 1967, at 09:30:42 UTC, as indicated by the TAKES_MEDICATION edge.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
