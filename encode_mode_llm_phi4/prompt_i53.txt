        The graph describes a scenario involving a patient, a medication, and an ingredient. Samatha Mueller845, who lives at 531 Collier Wynd and was born on February 14, 1941, is identified as the patient (Node ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6400). She has a relationship with Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet, which is labeled as medication (Node ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6697) and described by the code '855332'. Samatha takes this medication from June 17, 2005, to July 22, 2005.

The Coumadin tablet contains warfarin as an ingredient (Node ID: 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6698). There is a relationship indicating that the medication has this ingredient. Additionally, Samatha is allergic to warfarin, although there are no specific start or stop dates associated with this allergy.

The relationships and properties in the graph indicate that while Samatha takes Coumadin, she is also allergic to one of its ingredients, warfarin.

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
