Explanation:
- The inconsistency arises from Samatha Mueller being incorrectly marked as allergic to Olmesartan, which is an ingredient in the medication Tribenzor she takes. Since this allergy information is noted as erroneous, the relationship `[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]` between Samatha and Olmesartan should be removed.
