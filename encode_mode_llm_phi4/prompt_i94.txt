Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        There is an ingredient identified as mestranol ([Node ID: 6776]) which is part of a medication called Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension ([Node ID: 6786]). The medication has the code '106892' and shares the same timestamp (tau_o) as the ingredient, indicating their simultaneous creation or update.

The patient, Earle679 Frami345 ([Node ID: 6408]), who lived at 208 Kilback Center Unit 20, was born on May 7, 1917, and passed away on January 23, 2018. This patient is allergic to mestranol ([Edge Type: ALLERGIC_TO]) with no errors reported in the data.

Additionally, Earle679 Frami345 took Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension starting and stopping on June 2, 2014, at 13:57:11 UTC ([Edge Type: TAKES_MEDICATION]), with no errors noted in this record.

The medication contains mestranol as an ingredient ([Edge Type: HAS_INGREDIENT]) with a timestamp (tau_o) of 1, but there is an error associated with this relationship.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
