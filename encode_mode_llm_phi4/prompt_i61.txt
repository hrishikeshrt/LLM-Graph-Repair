Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        RETURN *
        The graph represents a scenario involving a patient, medication, and an ingredient. 

There is a node labeled "Ingredient" with the ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691], which refers to ferrous sulfate. Another node labeled "Medication" with the ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750] describes a medication known as 24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet, identified by code '860975'. 

A third node labeled "Patient" with the ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840] represents a patient named Sanford861 Fritsch593. This patient was born on June 22, 1923, and resides at 935 Rempel Trail.

The graph includes several relationships:
1. The medication [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750] has ferrous sulfate as an ingredient, indicated by the edge labeled "HAS_INGREDIENT" with a property 'is_error' set to '1'.
2. The patient [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840] is allergic to ferrous sulfate, as shown by an edge labeled "ALLERGIC_TO" without any start or stop dates and with a property 'is_error' set to '0'.
3. The patient [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840] takes the medication [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750], with a start date of July 21, 2000, and a stop date of September 15, 2000.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
