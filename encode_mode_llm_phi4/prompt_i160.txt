Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        There is an ingredient node identified by the ID `cecb7ece-fb70-4a7f-b51d-6e8dd1506ad9` labeled as "Ingredient," which represents ferrous sulfate. There is a medication node with the code '860975' and ID `6691`, labeled as "Medication." This medication is described as "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet."

A patient node, identified by the ID `cecb7ece-fb70-4a7f-b51d-6e8dd1506ad9` and labeled as "Patient," represents Isiah14 Fritsch593, who was born on January 6, 1951, and resides at 690 Stark Vista. 

The medication node is connected to the ingredient node via an edge indicating that it has ferrous sulfate as an ingredient. However, this relationship is marked with an error.

Additionally, there is an edge from the patient node to the ingredient node labeled "ALLERGIC_TO," suggesting a potential allergy to ferrous sulfate for the patient, but no specific start or stop date is provided, and no error is indicated in this relation.

Finally, another edge connects the patient node to the medication node, indicating that Isiah14 Fritsch593 takes the medication described as "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" from October 1, 2011, to October 15, 2011. This relationship does not have any errors noted.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
