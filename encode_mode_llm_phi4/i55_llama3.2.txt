Given the inconsistency, I suggest the following repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
ADD_NODE | Samantha Mueller | {name: 'Samantha Mueller', birthdate: '1941-02-14', residence: '531 Collier Wynd'}
</repairs>

These repairs first remove the incorrect allergy relationship, and then add a new node for Samantha Mueller with accurate properties.
