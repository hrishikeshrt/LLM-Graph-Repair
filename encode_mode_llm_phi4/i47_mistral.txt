Explanation: The patient is allergic to the ingredient, but the ingredient should not be marked as causing an allergy reaction (`tau_o` property set to 1). To correct this inconsistency, we update the `Ingredient` node's `tau_o` property to 0 and delete the edge connecting the patient to the ingredient with the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship type.
