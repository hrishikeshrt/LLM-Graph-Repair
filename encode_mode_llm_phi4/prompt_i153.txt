        The graph describes a scenario involving a patient named Isiah14 Fritsch593, who lives at 690 Stark Vista and was born on January 6, 1951. The patient is associated with two other entities: a medication and an ingredient.

The medication is described as "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet," which has the code '860975'. This medication contains ferrous sulfate as one of its ingredients. There is a relationship indicating that the medication has ferrous sulfate, but this connection is marked with an error status.

Isiah14 Fritsch593 is allergic to ferrous sulfate and has been taking the Glucophage medication from November 4, 2017, until December 9, 2017. The allergy information does not specify any start or stop dates, while the medication-taking period is clearly defined with a start and end date.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
