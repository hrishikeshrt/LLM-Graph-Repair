The inconsistency in this graph pattern lies in the fact that Logan Brekke, who passed away on May 2, 2009, has a relationship indicating he took medication starting and stopping on November 17, 1999. This is logically inconsistent because it implies an action (taking medication) after his death.

To correct this inconsistency, we need to remove the edge indicating that Logan Brekke took the medication, as it cannot be true given his date of death.
