The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the fact that a patient, Altha90 Rolfson709, is taking a medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic. This situation should be flagged or documented more explicitly for safety reasons.

To address this, we can add a property to the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship to indicate that there is a potential risk due to the patient's current medication regimen. Hereâ€™s how you could represent this:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {risk: "High", note: "Patient is taking medication containing an allergen"}
