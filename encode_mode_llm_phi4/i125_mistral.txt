   Explanation: The current graph indicates that the patient is allergic to 'oxycodone' but the allergy was recorded after the patient's birthdate. To fix this inconsistency, we remove 'oxycodone' as an ingredient from the ingredient node and add a new edge representing the allergy with appropriate start date (birthdate of the patient).
