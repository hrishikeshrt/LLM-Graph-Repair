The inconsistency in the graph arises from the `is_error` property being set to '1' for the edge connecting the medication node to the ingredient node. This suggests there might be an issue with the connection, possibly indicating that Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection should not contain oxycodone as an ingredient.

To address this inconsistency, we need to correct the `is_error` property on the relevant edge:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {is_error: '0'}
</repairs>
