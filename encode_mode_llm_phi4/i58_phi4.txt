The inconsistency identified in the graph involves an erroneous relationship between the medication node and the ingredient node. The medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" should not contain ferrous sulfate as an ingredient, which is indicated by the marked error on this edge.

To correct this factual inconsistency, we need to remove the incorrect relationship that states the medication has ferrous sulfate as an ingredient.
