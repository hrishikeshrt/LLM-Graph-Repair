The inconsistency in the graph arises from the fact that the patient Valrie435 Mertz280 is allergic to mestranol, yet she has been taking a medication containing mestranol. This situation poses a risk and should be addressed.

To resolve this issue, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient is taking the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," as it contains an allergen for the patient.
