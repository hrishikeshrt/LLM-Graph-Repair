The inconsistency in the graph is that Logan Brekke, who is allergic to oxycodone, is taking a medication (Epogen) that contains oxycodone. To address this issue:

1. Remove the relationship indicating that Logan takes Epogen.
2. Correct the error property on the HAS_INGREDIENT edge between Epogen and oxycodone.
