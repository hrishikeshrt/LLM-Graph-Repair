Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. Ferrous sulfate is identified as an ingredient with the ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93` (Node 6691), possessing a property `tau_o` of 1. A medication called "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" is represented by Node 6750, with the code '860975', and also has a `tau_o` value of 1.

The patient, identified as Sanford861 Fritsch593 (Node 5840), resides at 935 Rempel Trail. The birthdate of this patient is June 22, 1923, and there is no recorded death date. This patient has an empty list for `tau_k` and a `tau_o` value of 0.

The edges in the graph describe relationships between these entities: 

1. There is a relationship from the medication (Node 6750) to ferrous sulfate (Node 6691), labeled as HAS_INGREDIENT, with properties indicating `tau_o` of 1 and an error status (`is_error`) marked as '1'.

2. The patient (Node 5840) has an ALLERGIC_TO relationship with ferrous sulfate (Node 6691). This relationship does not specify start or stop times and has a `tau_o` value of 0, with no errors indicated.

3. Finally, the patient (Node 5840) is linked to taking the medication (Node 6750) through a TAKES_MEDICATION edge, which specifies that this activity started on August 25, 2006, and stopped on September 15, 2006, with a `tau_o` value of 0 and no errors.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
