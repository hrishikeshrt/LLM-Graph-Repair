Explanation:
- The inconsistency lies in the `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the medication "Epogen" and the ingredient "oxycodone," as indicated by the property `'is_error' = '1'`.
- Since oxycodone is not an actual ingredient of Epogen, this relationship should be removed to correct the factual error.
