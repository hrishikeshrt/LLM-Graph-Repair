Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is identified as "oxycodone" with the ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757]. This ingredient is part of a medication called "Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," which has the code '205923' and is described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846]. 

A patient named Logan Brekke, with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203], is linked to both the ingredient and the medication. Logan has an allergy to oxycodone, indicated by the "ALLERGIC_TO" relationship, but no error in this connection (is_error: '0'). Additionally, Logan was taking the Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection medication on April 3, 2000, as specified by the "TAKES_MEDICATION" edge. 

The ingredient oxycodone is also associated with the medication through a "HAS_INGREDIENT" relationship, but this connection has an error flag (is_error: '1').

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
