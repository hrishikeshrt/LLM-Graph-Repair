Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a scenario involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is oxycodone (Node ID: 6757), which has a property indicating its tau_o value as 1. There is also a medication described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" (Node ID: 6846) with properties including a code '205923', a description, and a tau_o value of 1.

The patient, identified by the first name Sanford861 and last name Fritsch593, was born on June 22, 1923. The patient's address is 935 Rempel Trail (Node ID: 5840), with a tau_k property that is an empty list, indicating no known allergies, and a tau_o value of 0.

The relationships between these nodes are as follows:

1. The medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" has oxycodone as one of its ingredients (Edge ID: 52036). This relationship is marked with a type 'HAS_INGREDIENT' and includes properties such as tau_o value of 1, and an error indicator set to '1'.

2. The patient, Sanford861 Fritsch593, is allergic to oxycodone (Edge ID: 985), indicated by the relationship type 'ALLERGIC_TO'. This edge has no start or stop dates for the allergy, a tau_o value of 0, and an error indicator set to '0'.

3. The patient takes the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" (Edge ID: 840), with both the start and stop times recorded as March 3, 2018, at 09:55:43 UTC. This relationship is of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION', has a tau_o value of 0, and no error indicator specified.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
