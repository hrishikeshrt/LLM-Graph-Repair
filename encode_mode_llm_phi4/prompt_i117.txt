Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        RETURN *
        The graph describes a scenario involving an ingredient, medication, and a patient. There is an ingredient labeled as "oxycodone" with the property `id` of 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757'. This ingredient is part of a medication described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," which has a code '205923' and the property `id` of 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846'. The patient, identified by the `id` '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d', is named Sanford861 Fritsch593 and resides at 935 Rempel Trail. The patient was born on June 22, 1923.

There are three relationships in the graph: 

1. The medication contains the ingredient oxycodone, indicated by a "HAS_INGREDIENT" edge with an error flag set to '1'.
2. The patient is allergic to oxycodone, as shown by an "ALLERGIC_TO" edge without any errors.
3. The patient takes the Epogen medication, starting and stopping on December 21, 2013, at 09:55:43Z, with no error indicated in this relationship.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
