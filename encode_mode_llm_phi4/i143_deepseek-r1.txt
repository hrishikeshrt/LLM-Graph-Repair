Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this graph inconsistency. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, there's a patient named Samatha Mueller846 who takes a medication called Tribenzor. This medication contains Olmesartan along with Amlodipine and HCTZ. The issue here is that the relationship between the medication and its ingredients might be incorrect.

Looking at the graph, I see that there's an edge from the medication node (Tribenzor) to the ingredient Olmesartan with a label HAS_INGREDIENT. However, according to the description, Tribenzor includes multiple ingredients: Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG / Olmesartan medoxomil 20 MG Oral Tablet.

So, right now, the graph only shows that Tribenzor has Olmesartan as an ingredient. It's missing the other two components of the medication: Amlodipine and HCTZ. This is a problem because Tribenzor should have all three ingredients listed correctly.

To fix this, I need to add those missing edges from Tribenzor to Amlodipine and HCTZ. That way, the graph accurately reflects that Tribenzor contains all three components.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add an edge between Tribenzor and Amlodipine with the label HAS_INGREDIENT.
2. Add another edge between Tribenzor and HCTZ with the same label.

This should correct the inconsistency by including all the necessary ingredients in the medication's relationship.
