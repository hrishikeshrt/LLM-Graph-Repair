Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a network involving an ingredient, medication, and a patient. The node with ID `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757` is labeled as "Ingredient" and specifically refers to oxycodone. Another node, `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846`, is categorized under "Medication" and describes a medication with the code '205923', which is 1 mL of Epogen at a concentration of 4000 UNT/ML injection. The third node, `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840`, represents a patient named Sanford861 Fritsch593, born on June 22, 1923, residing at 935 Rempel Trail.

There are three edges in the graph. The first edge connects the medication node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846` to the ingredient node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757`, indicating that the medication has oxycodone as an ingredient. The second edge links the patient node `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840` to the ingredient node, suggesting that the patient is allergic to oxycodone. Finally, the third edge connects the patient node to the medication node, showing that Sanford861 Fritsch593 was taking the Epogen injection from May 13, 2017, at 09:55:43Z until the same time on the same day.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
