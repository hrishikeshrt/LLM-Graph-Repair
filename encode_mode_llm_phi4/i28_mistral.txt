The reason for the suggested repairs is that Logan Brekke was born in 1913 and died in 2009. However, the tau_o value of the edge connecting him to the ingredient oxycodone is currently 0, which suggests he was not allergic at the time of death. To correct this inconsistency, we update Logan Brekke's birth and death years, set the tau_o value of the allergy edge to 1 (indicating an allergy throughout his life), and leave other properties unchanged.
