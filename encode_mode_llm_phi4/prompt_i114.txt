Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is oxycodone, which has a property `tau_o` set to 1 and an identifier of `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757`. This ingredient is part of the medication described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" with a code '205923', also having a `tau_o` value of 1. The patient, identified by `3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d`, is named Sanford861 Fritsch593 and resides at 935 Rempel Trail; they were born on June 22, 1923.

There are three relationships in the graph: 
1. The medication contains oxycodone as an ingredient (`HAS_INGREDIENT`), with a `tau_o` value of 1 and marked as having an error.
2. The patient is allergic to oxycodone (`ALLERGIC_TO`), without any start or stop dates, and this relationship has no errors.
3. The patient takes the medication Epogen, starting and stopping on April 17, 2014, at 09:55:43 UTC, with no error in this record.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
