    UPD_NODE | i:Ingredient {id: 'exemestane'} | allergyFlag: false  <!-- Update the ingredient node to indicate it is not allergenic for this context -->

``` 

These operations address the inconsistency by removing the incorrect relationship between the medication and the ingredient, as well as updating the ingredient's properties to reflect that it should not be flagged as an allergen in this specific case.
