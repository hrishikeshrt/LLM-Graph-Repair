The patient node needs to be updated with the correct birthdate. A new edge is added between the patient and ingredient nodes indicating an allergy to oxycodone, as the patient is allergic to it despite not having specific start or stop dates provided. The relationship between the medication and ingredient nodes is removed since Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection does not contain oxycodone as an ingredient.
