Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        In the graph, there is a node labeled as "Ingredient" with an ID of `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6751`, representing metformin. Another node, labeled as "Medication," has an ID of `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750` and describes a 24-hour Glucophage 500 MG extended-release oral tablet with the code '860975'. There is also a node labeled as "Patient" with an ID of `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5902`, representing a patient named Reyna401 Shanahan202, born on February 26, 1949, residing at 824 Schuppe Gate Unit 70.

An edge connects the "Medication" node to the "Ingredient" node with a type of HAS_INGREDIENT, indicating that metformin is an ingredient in the Glucophage medication. Another edge links the "Patient" node to the "Ingredient" node with a type of ALLERGIC_TO, suggesting that Reyna401 Shanahan202 might be allergic to metformin, although this information is marked as erroneous.

Additionally, there is an edge from the "Patient" node to the "Medication" node with a type of TAKES_MEDICATION. This indicates that Reyna401 Shanahan202 took the Glucophage medication starting on February 3, 2018, and stopped on March 3, 2018.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
