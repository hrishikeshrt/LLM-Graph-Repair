Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are three main entities: a patient (Sanford861 Fritsch593), a medication (Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection), and an ingredient (oxycodone). The relationships between them involve taking medication, having ingredients, and being allergic.

Looking at the properties:

- Oxycodone has `tau_o` set to 1.
- Epogen also has `tau_o` as 1 but contains oxycodone with `is_error` '1'.
- The patient's `tau_o` is 0.
- Allergy to oxycodone is marked correctly with `is_error` '0'.

The inconsistency seems to be that the medication (Epogen) has an error in its ingredient list, while the allergy information for the patient is correct. This might cause issues because if someone takes a medication with an error in its ingredients and also has an allergy to one of those ingredients, it could lead to unexpected problems.

So, I think the problem here is that Epogen's `is_error` property should match the patient's allergy status. If Epogen's ingredient list has an error, but the patient doesn't have an allergy (or vice versa), this inconsistency needs to be resolved.

To fix this, perhaps we should update the `is_error` property of the Epogen medication edge so that it matches the patient's allergy information. Since the patient's allergy is correctly marked as '0', we can set Epogen's `is_error` to '0' as well.
