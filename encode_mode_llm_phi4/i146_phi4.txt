Explanation of the repairs:

1. **UPD_NODE**: The `tau_o` property for Olmesartan is set to 1, which seems consistent with its use in Tribenzor. However, there's an indication that the allergic reaction information is erroneous (`is_error: '1'`). Since the error flag is on the ingredient node and not directly related to the allergy relationship, we update the `is_error` property of the Olmesartan ingredient node to 0 to reflect that it should not be marked as erroneous.

2. **DEL_EDGE**: The relationship `[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]` between Samatha Mueller and Olmesartan is noted as erroneous due to the allergy being incorrectly recorded. Therefore, this relationship should be removed to correct the inconsistency in the graph.
