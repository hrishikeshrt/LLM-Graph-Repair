Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

First, there are two medications connected through an ingredient called oxycodone. One is Epogen Injection (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846) which has 4000 units per mL, and the other is Oxycodone (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757). The problem seems to be that Epogen Injection has oxycodone as an ingredient with a tau_o of 1, but it's marked as an error. On the other hand, Logan Brekke is allergic to oxycodone, which should have a tau_o of 0.

Wait, so if Epogen Injection contains oxycodone and is_error is '1', that means there's a conflict because someone allergic to oxycodone shouldn't be taking it. That doesn't make sense. So maybe the error flag on the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship is incorrect.

Looking at the relationships:
- Epogen Injection has oxycodone with tau_o=1 and is_error='1'. This probably means that the system detected an error because someone allergic took it.
- Allergic_to relationship for oxycodone has tau_o=0, which is correct since Logan Brekke isn't allergic.

So the issue is likely that Epogen Injection shouldn't have an error because it's a different medication. The error should be on the TAKES_MEDICATION or HAS_INGREDIENT relationships of Epogen Injection, not on its ALLERGIC_TO relationship.

Therefore, I think we need to remove the is_error='1' from the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship of Epogen Injection.
