The inconsistency lies in the medication's relationship with the ingredient oxycodone, which has an error flag (`is_error: '1'`). This suggests that the link between the medication and the ingredient is incorrect. Given that the patient is allergic to oxycodone, this erroneous link could lead to a dangerous situation if not corrected.

To address this inconsistency:

1. Remove the erroneous relationship between the medication and the ingredient.
2. Ensure there are no other unintended relationships or properties associated with this error.
