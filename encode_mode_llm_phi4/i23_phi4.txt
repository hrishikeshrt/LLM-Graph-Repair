The inconsistency in the graph arises from the fact that Logan Brekke496, who has an allergy to oxycodone (`tau_o`: 0), took a medication (Epogen) that contains oxycodone as an ingredient. Additionally, there is an error indicated on the edge between Epogen and oxycodone (`is_error`: '1').

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the relationship indicating that Logan Brekke496 takes Epogen, since he has an allergy to one of its ingredients.
2. Correct the error status on the edge between Epogen and oxycodone if it is indeed correct (i.e., remove `is_error`).

Here are the suggested repairs:
