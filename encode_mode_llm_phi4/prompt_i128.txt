        The graph describes a medical scenario involving three entities: an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is oxycodone (Node ID: [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757]), which falls under the label 'Ingredient' with a property `tau_o` of 1.

The medication, labeled as 'Medication', is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection (Node ID: [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846]). It has a code '205923' and also possesses the property `tau_o` of 1. This medication contains oxycodone as an ingredient, indicated by an edge with type HAS_INGREDIENT (key: [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036]) that has a property `is_error` set to '1'.

The patient is Sanford861 Fritsch593 (Node ID: [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840]), who resides at 935 Rempel Trail and was born on June 22, 1923. The property `tau_o` for this patient is 0. There are two edges involving the patient: one indicating an allergy to oxycodone (type ALLERGIC_TO, key: [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:985]) with `is_error` set to '0', and another showing that the patient takes Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection (type TAKES_MEDICATION, key: [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:618]), starting and stopping on February 21, 2013, at 09:55:43Z.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
