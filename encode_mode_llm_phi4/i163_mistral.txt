This repair suggests updating the ingredient node to have tau_o property set to 0, and removing the error flag from the edge connecting Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension and mestranol. This change makes the graph consistent, as a patient should not be allergic to an ingredient that they take in a medication.
