To resolve this, we can update the tau_o property of mestranol to 0 (since it seems there might be a confusion with another ingredient) and add a new ingredient for Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension with a tau_o of 1. This will ensure that the medication has an accurate list of ingredients without any errors.",
