Explanation: The current graph shows that Logan Brekke is allergic to oxycodone (ingredient with tau_o = 1), but he also takes a medication containing oxycodone (Epogen Injection). To resolve this inconsistency, we should update the allergy property of oxycodone (tau_o = 0) and remove the allergy relationship between Logan Brekke and oxycodone.
