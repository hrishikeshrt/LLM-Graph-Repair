The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the fact that a patient who takes a medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic should not be taking that medication. The presence of both `TAKES_MEDICATION` and `ALLERGIC_TO` edges for the same ingredient indicates this conflict.

To resolve this, we can remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge between the patient and the medication, as it is unsafe for the patient to take a medication containing an allergen. This ensures that the graph accurately reflects the medical constraints.
