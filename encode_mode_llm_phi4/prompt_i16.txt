        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is oxycodone, identified by the ID e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757. It is associated with a medication described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," which has the code '205923' and is identified by the ID e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
