The inconsistency arises because the patient, Sanford861 Fritsch593, is allergic to oxycodone but is also taking a medication that contains oxycodone as an ingredient. This situation should not occur in a real-world scenario due to safety concerns.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the edge indicating that the patient takes the medication containing oxycodone.
2. Optionally, if there's no other reason for the patient to be taking this medication, consider removing the relationship between the medication and the ingredient as well, although this may not always be necessary unless it is confirmed that the medication does not actually contain oxycodone.

Here are the suggested repairs:
