Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient, identified as mestranol (Node ID: 6776), is part of the Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension (Node ID: 6786). This medication has a code '106892' and is described as "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension." There is an edge indicating that this medication contains the ingredient mestranol, marked with a type 'HAS_INGREDIENT,' which also notes an error status.

The patient in question, Logan Brekke (Node ID: 6203), has an address at 1081 Orn Street and was born on May 30, 1913. The patient passed away on May 2, 2009. There are two key relationships involving the patient:

1. An edge labeled 'ALLERGIC_TO' connects Logan Brekke to mestranol, indicating an allergy to this ingredient without any error noted.
   
2. Another edge labeled 'TAKES_MEDICATION' links Logan Brekke to Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, showing that he took this medication from November 11, 1983, until December 16, 1983. This connection also indicates no errors in the record.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
