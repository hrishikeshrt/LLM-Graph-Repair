This repair suggests updating the patient node with the correct birthdate and living location, and adding an edge between the patient and Tenoretic medication to reflect that Cassandra224 took this medication from March 29, 1982, until April 4, 1983. The allergy information is incorrect, so no repair operations are suggested for the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship or the ingredient node.
