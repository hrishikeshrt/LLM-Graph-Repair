Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        There are three nodes in the graph. The first node represents an ingredient with ID `e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93` (Node 6847), labeled as "Ingredient," and is identified as 'epoetin alfa'. The second node, also under the same ID but Node 6846, represents a medication labeled as "Medication" with code '205923', described as '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'.

The third node (Node 6465) is a patient identified by ID `19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b`, named Walker122 Kuhic920, born on September 6, 1914, and deceased on March 19, 1977. The patient's address is listed as '524 Brekke Dale Suite 9'.

There are three edges connecting these nodes:

1. An edge from the medication node (Node 6846) to the ingredient node (Node 6847), indicating that the medication has epoetin alfa as an ingredient.
2. An edge from the patient node (Node 6465) to the ingredient node (Node 6847), suggesting that the patient is allergic to epoetin alfa, although this information is marked with an error.
3. Another edge from the patient node (Node 6465) to the medication node (Node 6846), indicating that the patient took the medication Epogen on July 18, 1976, at exactly 09:30:42 UTC, and stopped taking it at the same time.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
