   The repair suggested is to update the ingredient node (with id 6776) to have an error status, indicating that there may be an issue with this ingredient. Additionally, since mestranol is not actually an ingredient in Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, we remove the edge connecting it to the medication through the 'HAS_INGREDIENT' relationship.
