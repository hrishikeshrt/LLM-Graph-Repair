The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves a patient being incorrectly marked as allergic to an ingredient that they are taking as medication. The relationship indicating an allergy (`ALLERGIC_TO`) between the "Patient" node and the "Ingredient" node is erroneous.

To correct this factual inconsistency, we need to remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` edge between the patient and the ingredient nodes.
