   The first repair operation removes the erroneous allergy relationship between the patient and epoetin alfa. The second repair operation removes the incorrect "HAS_INGREDIENT" relationship between the medication and epoetin alfa. The third repair operation adds a corrected "ALLERGIC_TO" relationship between the patient and epoetin alfa, with start and end times corresponding to the patient's birth and death dates. The fourth repair operation adds a new "HAS_INGREDIENT" relationship between the medication and epoetin alfa, but marks it as erroneous.
