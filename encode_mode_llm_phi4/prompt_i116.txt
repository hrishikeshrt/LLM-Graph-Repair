Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes three entities: an ingredient (oxycodone), a medication (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection), and a patient named Sanford861 Fritsch. The medication contains oxycodone as an ingredient, but there is an error associated with this relationship. Additionally, the patient, Sanford861 Fritsch, who resides at 935 Rempel Trail and was born on June 22, 1923, has an allergy to oxycodone. Furthermore, the patient takes the medication Epogen, starting and stopping on July 2, 2015, without any errors in this relationship.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
