Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),

        The graph describes a scenario involving a patient, a medication, and an ingredient. The patient, identified as Walker122 Kuhic920 (ID: 19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b), was born on September 6, 1914, lived at 524 Brekke Dale Suite 9, and passed away on March 19, 1977. The medication in question is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection (code: 205923) with a description "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection." This medication contains an ingredient known as epoetin alfa.

There are several relationships depicted between these entities:

1. The medication has epoetin alfa as an ingredient, indicated by the edge labeled HAS_INGREDIENT.
2. The patient is allergic to epoetin alfa, denoted by the edge labeled ALLERGIC_TO, although this record contains an error.
3. The patient took the medication Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection starting and stopping on December 21, 1975, at 09:30:42 UTC, as shown by the edge labeled TAKES_MEDICATION.

These relationships are captured with specific timestamps (tau_o) and error flags where applicable.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
