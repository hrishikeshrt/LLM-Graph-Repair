        The graph contains three nodes and three edges. 

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757] is labeled as an "Ingredient" with the ID 'oxycodone' and a property 'tau_o' of 1.

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] is labeled as a "Medication" with properties including a code '205923', a description '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', and a property 'tau_o' of 1.

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203] is labeled as a "Patient" named Logan Brekke, with an address at '1081 Orn Street', a birthdate of May 30, 1913, and a death date of May 2, 2009. The patient has no recorded tau_k values, a property 'tau_o' of 0, and the ID 'cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1'.

There is an edge from node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] to node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757], indicating that the medication has oxycodone as an ingredient. This edge is of type "HAS_INGREDIENT" with properties 'tau_o' of 1 and 'is_error' marked as '1'.

Another edge connects node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203] to node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757], showing that the patient is allergic to oxycodone. This edge is of type "ALLERGIC_TO" with properties 'tau_o' of 0 and 'is_error' marked as '0'.

Finally, there is an edge from node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203] to node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846], indicating that the patient takes Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
