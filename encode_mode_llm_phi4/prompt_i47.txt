Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph contains three nodes and three edges. The first node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6700) is labeled as an "Ingredient" with the ID 'verapamil' and has a property 'tau_o' set to 1. The second node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6699) is labeled as a "Medication," identified by code '897718', described as 'verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet,' and also has 'tau_o' set to 1. The third node (4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6588) is a "Patient" named Rosio404 Bayer639, born on September 5, 1914, and deceased on September 5, 2000, with an address at '856 Carroll Center Apt 22.' This patient has no recorded 'tau_k' values.

There are three edges connecting these nodes. The first edge (type: HAS_INGREDIENT) connects the medication node to the ingredient node with a key of 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51919, indicating that verapamil hydrochloride contains verapamil as an ingredient. The second edge (type: ALLERGIC_TO) connects the patient to the ingredient node with a key of 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:975, suggesting that Rosio404 Bayer639 is allergic to verapamil, although this information is marked as an error. The third edge (type: TAKES_MEDICATION) connects the patient to the medication node with a key of 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:81, indicating that Rosio404 Bayer639 took verapamil hydrochloride from September 5, 1987, to September 10, 1988.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
