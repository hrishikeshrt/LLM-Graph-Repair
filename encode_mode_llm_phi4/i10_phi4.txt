The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that Logan Brekke, who is allergic to oxycodone, has a relationship indicating he takes Epogen, which incorrectly lists oxycodone as an ingredient. This presents a factual error regarding medication ingredients.

To correct this inconsistency:

1. Remove the erroneous edge between the Medication node and the Ingredient node, as oxycodone should not be listed as an ingredient of Epogen.
2. Ensure that there is no misinformation about Logan Brekke taking a medication to which he is allergic by addressing any potential errors in the relationship properties.
