Explanation:
- The inconsistency arises from the erroneous allergy information for the patient Sanford861 Fritsch593, who is incorrectly marked as allergic to clopidogrel. Since this information is incorrect, the relationship `[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]` between the patient and the ingredient should be removed.
