Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, there are three nodes: a patient, a medication, and an ingredient. The relationships between them involve taking medication, having an ingredient, and being allergic to it. 

Looking at the data:
- The patient (Sanford861 Fritsch593) has a `tau_o` of 0 for both the medication and the allergy.
- The medication (Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) also has a `tau_o` of 0, but it's connected to the patient with `tau_o` 0 as well. However, the ingredient oxycodone is marked correctly with `tau_o` 1.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the medication is Epogen and contains oxycodone, then the `tau_o` for the medication should probably be related to whether it's an allergen or not. But in this case, the patient is allergic to oxycodone but has a non-allergic relationship with the medication.

Hmm, maybe the issue is that the medication shouldn't have an allergy indicator because it doesn't contain an allergen like oxycodone. So, the `tau_o` for the medication's relationship should be 0 instead of 1.

So, I think we need to change the `tau_o` property on the HAS_INGREDIENT edge from 1 to 0. That way, it correctly reflects that the patient is allergic to oxycodone but not to the medication itself.
