The inconsistency in this graph pattern arises from the following facts:

1. The patient Logan Brekke, who was born on May 30, 1913, and died on May 2, 2009, is still recorded as taking medication (Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) with a start and stop date of January 19, 2001.
2. Additionally, the patient's allergy to oxycodone is marked correctly without an error (`is_error` = 0), but the relationship indicating that the medication contains oxycodone as an ingredient has an error (`is_error` = 1).

To resolve these inconsistencies:

- The `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge should be removed because it incorrectly records a living patient taking medication after their death.
- The `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge's error status should be corrected to reflect that there is no known issue with the ingredient information.

Here are the suggested repairs:
