Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

So, there are three nodes: Patient (p), Medication (m), and Ingredient (i). The edges connect them with relationships like TAKES_MEDICATION, HAS_INGREDIENT, and ALLERGIC_TO.

The problem is that both the medication node (6750) and the ingredient node (6691) have a property called `tau_o` set to 1. But wait, the medication contains ferrous sulfate, which should be an ingredient in it. So if both nodes have `tau_o` as 1, that might mean they're considering each other's safety or something else related.

Looking at the edges:
- The medication has a relationship HAS_INGREDIENT with the ingredient. This edge also sets `tau_o` to 1 and marks `is_error` as '1'. But since ferrous sulfate is indeed an ingredient in the medication, this should be correct.
  
- The ALLERGIC_TO relationship from the patient to the ingredient has `tau_o` as 0. That seems fine because the patient isn't allergic.

Hmm, maybe the issue is that both nodes have the same `tau_o` value of 1 when they shouldn't? Or perhaps one should be 0 and the other 1 based on their roles in the medication.

Wait, the medication has its own `tau_o` as 1. Since it's a medication, maybe it makes sense for it to have that property indicating some status. The ingredient also having `tau_o` as 1 might not be necessary or could cause confusion because they're both pointing to each other in different ways.

So perhaps the fix is to remove the `tau_o` from the ingredient node (6691). That way, only the medication has this property, which seems more appropriate since it's a medication. The HAS_INGREDIENT edge can still have its own properties without affecting the medication's status.
