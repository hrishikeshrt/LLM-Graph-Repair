        The graph contains three nodes and three edges. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691] is labeled as an "Ingredient" with the properties of having a tau_o value of 1 and being identified as 'ferrous sulfate'. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750] is labeled as a "Medication" with a code '860975', a tau_o value of 1, and described as '24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet'. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5589] is labeled as a "Patient" with the address '690 Stark Vista', birthdate '1951-01-06', tau_k as an empty list, last name 'Fritsch593', tau_o value of 0, no death date, id 'cecb7ece-fb70-4a7f-b51d-6e8dd1506ad9', and first name 'Isiah14'.

There are three edges in the graph. The edge from [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750] to [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691] has a key of 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51961, is of type HAS_INGREDIENT, and has properties tau_o value of 1 and an error flag '1'. The edge from [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5589] to [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691] has a key of 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:993, is of type ALLERGIC_TO, and has properties with empty start and stop dates, tau_o value of 0, and an error flag '0'. The edge from [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5589] to [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750] has a key of 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:701, is of type TAKES_MEDICATION, and has properties with start date '2007-04-07T06:11:10Z', stop date '2007-04-28T06:11:10Z', and tau_o value of 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
