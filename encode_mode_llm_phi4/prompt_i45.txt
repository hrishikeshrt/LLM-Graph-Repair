        The graph contains three nodes and three edges. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6700] is labeled as an "Ingredient" with the ID 'verapamil' and a property 'tau_o' set to 1. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6699] is labeled as a "Medication," identified by the code '897718', described as 'verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet,' and has a property 'tau_o' set to 1. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6588] represents a "Patient" named Rosio404 Bayer639, born on September 5, 1914, residing at 856 Carroll Center Apt 22, with no 'tau_k' property, deceased on September 5, 2000, and has an ID of 'b5581477-7033-4586-bc95-da6a508bdab6', with a property 'tau_o' set to 0.

The first edge connects the "Medication" node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6699] to the "Ingredient" node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6700], indicating that the medication has verapamil as an ingredient, with a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and no error ('is_error': '0').

The second edge connects the "Patient" node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6588] to the "Ingredient" node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6700], indicating that Rosio404 Bayer639 is allergic to verapamil, with a property 'tau_o' set to 0 and an error present ('is_error': '1').

The third edge connects the "Patient" node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6588] to the "Medication" node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6699], indicating that Rosio404 Bayer639 took verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet from August 24, 1985, to August 30, 1986.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
