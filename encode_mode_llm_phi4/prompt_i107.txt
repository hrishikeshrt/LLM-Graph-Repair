Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a scenario involving an ingredient, medication, and a patient. The ingredient is identified as oxycodone (Node ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757), which has the property of being used in certain medications. A specific medication described in the graph is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, with a unique code '205923' (Node ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846). This medication contains oxycodone as an ingredient, indicated by the edge labeled HAS_INGREDIENT, which also has an error property set to 1.

A patient named Sanford861 Fritsch593 (Node ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840) is associated with both oxycodone and Epogen. The graph shows that the patient is allergic to oxycodone, as indicated by the edge labeled ALLERGIC_TO, which has no error (is_error set to 0). Furthermore, the patient takes the medication Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, with a start and stop date of April 18, 2015, at 09:55:43Z, as indicated by the edge labeled TAKES_MEDICATION.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
