Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, medication, and a patient. The ingredient is oxycodone (Node ID: [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757]), which has the property of being identified by 'tau_o': 1.

The medication is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, identified by a code '205923' and described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" (Node ID: [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846]). This medication has the property of being associated with 'tau_o': 1.

The patient, Logan Brekke496, resides at 1081 Orn Street. He was born on May 30, 1913, and passed away on May 2, 2009 (Node ID: [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203]). The patient's information includes 'tau_o': 0.

There is a relationship between the medication and the ingredient where the medication has oxycodone as an ingredient (Edge ID: [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036]). This edge is marked by 'tau_o': 1 and indicates that there is an error with 'is_error': '1'.

The patient, Logan Brekke496, has an allergy to oxycodone (Edge ID: [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:970]). This relationship does not have a start or stop date and is marked by 'tau_o': 0 with no error ('is_error': '0').

Logan Brekke496 took the medication Epogen on March 14, 2005 (Edge ID: [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:480]). This relationship has both a start and stop date of March 14, 2005, at 23:35:03Z, with 'tau_o': 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
