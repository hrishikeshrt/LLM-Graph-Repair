The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that Moises22 Kerluke267, who is allergic to mestranol, is taking a medication that contains this allergen. This poses a risk and should be addressed.

To resolve this factual inconsistency, we can suggest removing the relationship indicating that Moises22 Kerluke267 takes Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, as it contains an ingredient he's allergic to.
