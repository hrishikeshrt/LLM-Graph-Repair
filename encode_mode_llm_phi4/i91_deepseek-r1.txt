Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. So, let's see what the problem is.

From the description, there are two relationships involving the ingredient mestranol: one as HAS_INGREDIENT and another as ALLERGIC_TO. The HAS_INGREDIENT relationship has an error mark ('is_error': '1'), while the ALLERGIC_TO doesn't have any errors. Also, the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship for Humulin 70/30 is marked with a timestamp (tau_o) of 0.

Hmm, I think the issue here is that the HAS_INGREDIENT edge is incorrectly marked as erroneous. Since it's part of the medication and clearly indicates an ingredient, it should be correct. So maybe we need to remove the error mark from this relationship.

Looking at the allowed operations, UPD_EDGE can modify an edge's properties, including 'is_error'. So I'll use that operation on the HAS_INGREDIENT edge to set its 'is_error' property to 0.

UPD_EDGE | [rm] | {is_error: 0}
