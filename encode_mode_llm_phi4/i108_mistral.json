We also remove the relationship between oxycodone and the medication since it is no longer an ingredient in the corrected graph.\n\nThe second repair suggests that the allergy information for the patient is incorrect, so we delete the existing 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship between the patient and oxycodone. We then create a new 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship with the correct start date (the patient's birthdate).\n\nThe third repair suggests that the tau_o value for the medication is incorrect, so we update it to 0. We also remove the error indicator from the 'HAS_INGREDIENT' relationship since it is no longer an error in the corrected graph.\n\nThe fourth repair suggests that the start date for the allergy of the patient is missing, so we add the correct start date (the patient's birthdate) to the 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship.",
