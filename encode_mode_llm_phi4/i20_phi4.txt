The inconsistency in this graph pattern arises from the fact that Logan Brekke496, who has a recorded death date of May 2, 2009, is linked to taking Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection on October 3, 2004. This implies an active medication relationship after his death, which is logically inconsistent.

To resolve this inconsistency, the edge indicating that Logan took the medication should be removed since he could not have taken it posthumously.
