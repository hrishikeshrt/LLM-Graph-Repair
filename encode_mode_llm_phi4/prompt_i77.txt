Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph consists of three nodes and three edges. 

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847] is labeled as an 'Ingredient' with the property id set to 'epoetin alfa'. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] is labeled as a 'Medication', identified by code '205923', and described as '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465] represents a 'Patient' named Walker122 Kuhic920, with an address at 524 Brekke Dale Suite 9, born on September 6, 1914, and deceased on March 19, 1977.

The edge from [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] to [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847] indicates a relationship of type 'HAS_INGREDIENT' with the property tau_o set to 1 and is_error marked as '0'. 

The edge from [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465] to [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847] represents an 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship with tau_o set to 0 and is_error marked as '1'. 

Finally, the edge from [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465] to [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] is of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION', with start and stop times both set to June 26, 1970, at 09:30:42Z, and tau_o set to 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
