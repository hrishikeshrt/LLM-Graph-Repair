The provided graph indicates that Epogen, a medication, contains oxycodone as an ingredient. However, it is not factually accurate for Epogen to contain oxycodone as its main active ingredient. The suggested repair operations are:

1. Update the properties of the Epogen (Medication) node to reflect the correct concentration and code.
2. Add a new edge from the Epogen (Medication) node to a new Ingredient node, indicating the actual ingredient of Epogen.
