      UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {is_error: '0'}
   </repairs>

   This repair updates the edge `[ra]` (ALLERGIC_TO) to mark it as not an error ('0'). The reason for this update is that Samatha Mueller846 is taking Tribenzor, which contains Olmesartan, and yet she is also marked as allergic to Olmesartan in the graph. Since Tribenzor contains Olmesartan, it's likely that Samatha is not actually allergic to Olmesartan.
