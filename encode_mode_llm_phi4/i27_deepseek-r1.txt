Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, there are two medications connected through an ingredient Oxycodone with `tau_o` set to 1, which is flagged as an error. The patient, Logan Breanke, has no `tau_o` value for the allergy relationship but it's not marked as an error. Also, the medication Epogen's `tau_o` is correctly at 0 without any issues.

So, focusing on the first issue: the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between Epogen and Oxycodone has `tau_o` set to 1. Since this is flagged as an error, I think we need to correct it. Maybe the `tau_o` should be 0 because it's a medication ingredient, not an allergen.

Next, for the allergy relationship, Logan Breanke is allergic to Oxycodone but has no `tau_o` value set. Perhaps this is intentional, so maybe there's nothing wrong here unless we need to add the property.

Looking at the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship between the patient and Epogen, it also has `tau_o` as 0 without an error flag. That seems correct since medications usually don't have allergen properties in their relationships.

So, the main issue is the HAS_INGREDIENT edge with `tau_o` set to 1. I'll need to remove this because it's incorrect for a medication-ingredient relationship.
