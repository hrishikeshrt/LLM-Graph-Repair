Based on the description provided, there are two main issues to address:

1. The `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship for mestranol in Humulin 70/30 is marked as erroneous (`is_error`: '1'). This suggests that mestranol should not be listed as an ingredient of this medication.

2. Logan Brekke496 is allergic to mestranol and has taken Humulin 70/30, which erroneously contains mestranol. Given the allergy information, it would be unsafe for Logan to have taken a medication containing an allergen.

To resolve these issues:

1. Remove the erroneous `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between Humulin 70/30 and mestranol.
2. Since Logan should not have taken Humulin 70/30 due to his allergy to mestranol, remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship for this period.
