The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves a patient, Sanford861 Fritsch593, who is allergic to oxycodone but also takes Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which contains oxycodone as an ingredient. This situation poses a potential health risk for the patient.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to ensure that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen. The repair operation should remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection.

Here are the suggested graph repairs:
