        The graph describes a medication-related scenario involving three entities: an ingredient, a medication, and a patient.

1. **Ingredient**: The entity with ID `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691` is labeled as an "Ingredient" and is identified by the name "ferrous sulfate."

2. **Medication**: The entity with ID `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750` is labeled as a "Medication." It is described as "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" and has the code '860975'.

3. **Patient**: The entity with ID `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5996` is labeled as a "Patient." This patient, named Marcellus Lemke830, was born on May 23, 1942, and resides at 170 Kerluke Extension Suite 51. There is no recorded death date.

The relationships between these entities are described by the edges:

1. The medication "24 HR Glucophage" contains the ingredient "ferrous sulfate." This relationship is marked with a type of "HAS_INGREDIENT," and it has an error status indicated as '1'.

2. The patient Marcellus Lemke830 is allergic to "ferrous sulfate." This relationship is labeled as "ALLERGIC_TO" and does not have any specified start or stop dates, nor does it indicate an error.

3. The patient Marcellus Lemke830 takes the medication "24 HR Glucophage." This "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship started on September 19, 1981, at 20:06:53 UTC and stopped on September 25, 1982, at 20:06:53 UTC. There is no error associated with this relationship.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
