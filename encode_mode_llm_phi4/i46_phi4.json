This indicates that there was a mistake in recording this allergy information.\n  \n- To correct this factual error, we update the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship by setting the `is_error` property to `'0'`, indicating that the recorded allergy is accurate and not an error.\n\nThis operation ensures the graph accurately reflects the patient's allergy status without removing any existing relationships.",
