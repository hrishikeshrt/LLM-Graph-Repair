To correct this inconsistency, we update the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship to remove the error by setting tau_o to 0. Additionally, since Earle679 Frami345 was reported as taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, but it contains mestranol which he is allergic to, we remove the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship to fix this inconsistency.",
