        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is identified as mestranol with the ID [e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6776] and labeled as such. It has a property tau_o of 1.

The medication, Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, is identified by the code '106892' with an ID [e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6786] and labeled as Medication. It also has a property tau_o of 1.

The patient, Boyd728 Beahan375, resides at 698 Lehner Light. Born on November 19, 1911, the patient died on November 3, 1975, and is identified by the ID [e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6223]. The patient has a tau_o of 0.

There are three key relationships in this graph:

1. The medication Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension includes mestranol as an ingredient, indicated by the edge with type HAS_INGREDIENT and property tau_o of 1, though it is marked as an error (is_error: '1').

2. The patient Boyd728 Beahan375 is allergic to mestranol, as shown by the ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient and the ingredient, without any start or stop dates, and no errors reported (is_error: '0').

3. The patient took Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension from July 28, 1974, to August 11, 1974, as indicated by the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship with specified start and stop times, and no error noted (tau_o of 0).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
