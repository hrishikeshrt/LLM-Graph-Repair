Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        The graph describes a network involving three entities: an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. 

1. The node labeled as "Ingredient" ([4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691]) represents ferrous sulfate.

2. The node labeled as "Medication" ([4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750]) is a 24-hour Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet, identified by the code '860975'.

3. The node labeled as "Patient" ([4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5589]) refers to Isiah14 Fritsch593, who was born on January 6, 1951, and resides at 690 Stark Vista.

The relationships between these nodes are as follows:

- The medication ([4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750]) has ferrous sulfate as an ingredient. This relationship is marked by the edge type "HAS_INGREDIENT" and indicates a potential error (is_error: '1').

- The patient ([4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5589]) is allergic to ferrous sulfate, as indicated by the "ALLERGIC_TO" edge type. There are no errors in this relationship (is_error: '0').

- The patient ([4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5589]) takes the medication ([4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750]), with a treatment period from August 16, 2003, to August 30, 2003. This relationship is marked by the "TAKES_MEDICATION" edge type and contains no errors (is_error: '0').

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
