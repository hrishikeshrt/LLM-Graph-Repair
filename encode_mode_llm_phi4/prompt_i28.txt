        The graph contains three nodes and three edges. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757] represents an ingredient labeled as "Ingredient" with the properties of having a tau_o value of 1 and an id of 'oxycodone'. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] is labeled as "Medication," identified by the code '205923', with a description of '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection' and also has a tau_o value of 1. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203] is labeled as "Patient," representing Logan Brekke, who resides at '1081 Orn Street', was born on May 30, 1913, and passed away on May 2, 2009. The patient node has a tau_o value of 0.

There are three edges connecting these nodes: 

1. An edge from the medication node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] to the ingredient node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757], indicating that the medication has oxycodone as an ingredient. This edge is labeled "HAS_INGREDIENT" and includes a tau_o value of 1 with an error flag set to '1'.

2. An edge from the patient node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203] to the ingredient node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757], indicating that Logan Brekke is allergic to oxycodone. This edge is labeled "ALLERGIC_TO" with a tau_o value of 0 and no error flag.

3. An edge from the patient node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203] to the medication node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846], indicating that Logan Brekke took Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, starting and stopping on November 17, 1999, at 23:35:03Z. This edge is labeled "TAKES_MEDICATION" with a tau_o value of 0 and no error flag.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
