This repair suggests modifying the birthdate of the patient Logan Brekke to a more reasonable year (1958 instead of 1913) and removing the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient oxycodone. These changes are factually accurate given the information provided in the description, as it is unlikely that a person born in 1913 would still be alive in 2009 and take medication with an Epogen code (4000 UNT/ML Injection) that was not introduced until the late 1980s.
