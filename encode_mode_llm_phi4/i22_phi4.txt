The inconsistency in the graph is that Logan Brekke, who is allergic to oxycodone, has a relationship indicating he takes Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which contains oxycodone as an ingredient. This situation could pose a health risk due to the allergy.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to address the "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship between Logan and Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection since it is not safe for him to take medication containing an allergen.
