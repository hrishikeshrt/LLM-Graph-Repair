        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is ferrous sulfate (Node ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691), which has a property indicating it was observed at time 1 (tau_o: 1). This ingredient is part of the medication, 24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet (Node ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750), which has a code "860975" and was also observed at time 1. This medication is taken by the patient, Sanford861 Fritsch593 (Node ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840), who lives at 935 Rempel Trail and was born on June 22, 1923. The patient has no recorded death date and was observed at time 0.

The ingredient ferrous sulfate is linked to the medication through a "HAS_INGREDIENT" relationship, which includes an error indicator set to '1'. Additionally, the patient is allergic to ferrous sulfate, as indicated by an "ALLERGIC_TO" edge with no start or stop times and no errors. The patient also takes the 24 HR Glucophage medication from August 19, 2011, to September 16, 2011, as shown by a "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
