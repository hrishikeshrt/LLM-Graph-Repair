        The graph describes a patient named Walker122 Kuhic920 (ID: [19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b]) who lived at 524 Brekke Dale Suite 9 and was born on September 6, 1914. The patient passed away on March 19, 1977.

A medication identified as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" (ID: [205923], tau_o: 1) is noted to contain an ingredient called epoetin alfa (ID: [6847], tau_o: 1). The medication has a code of 205923 and is associated with the patient through a "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship, which started and stopped on April 19, 1968, at 09:30:42Z.

The patient was allergic to epoetin alfa (ID: [6847]), as indicated by an "ALLERGIC_TO" relationship. However, this information is marked with an error status ("is_error": '1') and does not have a specified start or stop time.

Additionally, the medication contains epoetin alfa, as shown by a "HAS_INGREDIENT" relationship, which is not marked as erroneous.

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.
