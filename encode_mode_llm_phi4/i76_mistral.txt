   The first repair operation updates the "Ingredient" node's tau_o property to 0 since it should not have a value of 1 if it is an ingredient in a medication. The second repair operation sets the is_error property of the "ALLERGIC_TO" edge to 0, indicating that this patient is indeed allergic to the ingredient. This change corrects the inconsistency by removing the error flag from the edge.
