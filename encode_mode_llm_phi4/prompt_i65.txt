Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph contains three nodes and three edges. 

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6847] is labeled as an "Ingredient" and represents "epoetin alfa," with a property `tau_o` set to 1.

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] is labeled as a "Medication" and describes "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection," with properties including `code` '205923', `tau_o` set to 1, and the same description.

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6465] is labeled as a "Patient" named Walker122 Kuhic920. This patient was born on September 6, 1914, lived at 524 Brekke Dale Suite 9, and died on March 19, 1977.

There are three edges connecting these nodes:

1. An edge from [Node 6846] to [Node 6847], labeled "HAS_INGREDIENT," indicating that the medication contains epoetin alfa, with `tau_o` set to 1 and no error (`is_error`: '0').

2. An edge from [Node 6465] to [Node 6847], labeled "ALLERGIC_TO," suggesting an allergy to epoetin alfa for the patient, but marked as erroneous (`is_error`: '1') with `tau_o` set to 0.

3. An edge from [Node 6465] to [Node 6846], labeled "TAKES_MEDICATION," indicating that the patient took the medication starting and stopping on November 21, 1972, at 09:30:42Z, with `tau_o` set to 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
