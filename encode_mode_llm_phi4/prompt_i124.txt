Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        The graph contains three nodes and three edges. 

Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757 represents an ingredient labeled as "Ingredient" with the ID 'oxycodone' and a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846 is a medication labeled as "Medication," identified by code '205923'. It has the description "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" and a property 'tau_o' set to 1.

Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840 is a patient labeled as "Patient," with the first name "Sanford861" and last name "Fritsch593." The patient's address is "935 Rempel Trail," birthdate is June 22, 1923, and has an ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. The property 'tau_o' for this node is set to 0.

There are three edges connecting these nodes:

1. An edge from Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846 (Medication) to Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757 (Ingredient), indicating that the medication has oxycodone as an ingredient. This edge is of type 'HAS_INGREDIENT' with a property 'tau_o' set to 1 and marked as an error ('is_error': '1').

2. An edge from Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840 (Patient) to Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757 (Ingredient), indicating that the patient is allergic to oxycodone. This edge is of type 'ALLERGIC_TO' with a property 'tau_o' set to 0 and not marked as an error ('is_error': '0').

3. An edge from Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840 (Patient) to Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846 (Medication), indicating that the patient takes Epogen medication. This edge is of type 'TAKES_MEDICATION' with both start and stop times set to January 30, 2015, at 09:55:43 Zulu time, a property 'tau_o' set to 0, and not marked as an error.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
