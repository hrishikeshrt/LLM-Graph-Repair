The first repair operation updates the oxycodone ingredient node's `tau_o` property to 1 since it is an allergen for Logan Brekke. The second repair operation adds a new edge between the patient node (Logan Brekke) and the ingredient node (oxycodone), indicating that he is allergic to oxycodone, with a tau_o of 1 and an is_error value of '1'.
