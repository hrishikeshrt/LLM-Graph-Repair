```xml
<repairs>
    UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {is_error: '0'}
    ADD_NODE | (i) | {start_date: null, stop_date: null}
</repairs>
```

Explanation:
1. The `UPD_EDGE` operation corrects the error in the association between the medication and its ingredient by setting `is_error` to `'0'`.
2. The `ADD_NODE` operation adds properties for start and stop dates to the allergy node, even if they are null, to ensure consistency with other nodes that have such information.
