Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient (Walker122 Kuhic920), an ingredient, and a medication. The ingredient is identified as "epoetin alfa," while the medication is described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" with code '205923'. There are relationships between these entities: the medication contains the ingredient epoetin alfa. Additionally, the patient has an allergic reaction to epoetin alfa, although this information is marked as erroneous. Furthermore, it is noted that the patient took the medication Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection from May 30, 1970, at 09:30:42 UTC until the same date and time.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
