The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from a patient being allergic to an ingredient that they were taking as part of a medication. Specifically, Moises22 Kerluke267 is allergic to mestranol but was prescribed Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, which contains mestranol.

To resolve this factual inconsistency, we should remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen. This can be achieved by deleting the 'TAKES_MEDICATION' edge between Moises22 Kerluke267 and Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension.
