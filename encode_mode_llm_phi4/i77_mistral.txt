   The first set of repairs removes the allergy information for the patient and updates the medication node with a more accurate description that includes the ingredient name. The second set of repairs adds a new Ingredient node for Epoetin Alfa and establishes an 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship between the patient and the newly created ingredient.
