The inconsistency lies in the fact that the medication Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection contains oxycodone, but oxycodone should not be an ingredient of this medication. Additionally, the patient is allergic to oxycodone and takes a medication containing it, which presents a factual error.

To correct these issues:

1. Remove the incorrect relationship between Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection and oxycodone.
2. Optionally, if there's no other context indicating why this relationship was added with an error flag, remove the 'is_error' property from any existing relationships that might still be relevant.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>

If needed to address the erroneous flag:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {is_error: null}
</repairs> 

These operations ensure the graph accurately reflects that oxycodone is not an ingredient of Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection.
