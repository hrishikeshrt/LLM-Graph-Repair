Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me go through it step by step.

First, looking at the description, there's a patient who takes Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension. The medication has an ingredient called mestranol with tau_o set to 1. But then, the same ingredient is listed again with tau_o also set to 1 in another edge. That seems redundant and possibly incorrect.

I think the problem here is that the same relationship (HAS_INGREDIENT) is being added twice for the same ingredient and medication pair. This duplication might be causing inconsistencies because it's adding the same property multiple times, which isn't necessary.

So, the solution would be to remove one of those duplicate edges. That way, there's only one HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between the medication and the ingredient, keeping things clean and accurate.
