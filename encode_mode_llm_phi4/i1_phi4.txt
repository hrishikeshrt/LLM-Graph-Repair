The inconsistency arises because the patient, Earle679 Frami345, is allergic to exemestane but took a medication that contains exemestane as an ingredient. This situation poses a health risk and should be addressed in the graph.

To resolve this issue, we can suggest removing the relationship indicating that the patient takes HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet, which contains exemestane, since it contradicts the allergy information.
