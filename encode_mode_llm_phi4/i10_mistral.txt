This repair suggests updating the allergy relationship between Logan Brekke and oxycodone to indicate that he is allergic (`tau_o` set to 1) instead of not allergic (`tau_o` set to 0). Additionally, it removes the incorrect TAKES_MEDICATION relationship between Logan Brekke and Epogen. This repair assumes that Logan Brekke should be allergic to oxycodone but did not take Epogen.
