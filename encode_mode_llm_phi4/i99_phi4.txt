Explanation:
- The inconsistency involves an error noted in the relationship between the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" and its ingredient "mestranol".
- To correct this, we remove the erroneous property from the `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship by setting `error: null`. This operation assumes that the presence of an error is incorrect or should be cleared.
