To fix this inconsistency, we update the patient node with a `tau_o` value of 1. Additionally, since it is not appropriate for Logan Brekke to be allergic to Oxycodone given that he took Epogen (which contains Oxycodone as an ingredient), we remove the ALLERGIC_TO relationship between Logan Brekke and Oxycodone.",
