Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving three entities: an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. 

1. There is an ingredient identified by the ID `chlorthalidone` with a property `tau_o` set to 1.

2. A medication labeled as "Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet" has a code '746030', and its `tau_o` value is also 1. This medication contains the ingredient `chlorthalidone`, indicated by an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT with properties including `tau_o` set to 1 and `is_error` marked as '0'.

3. The patient, Cassandra224 O'Reilly797, resides at "1028 O'Hara Corner Unit 84" and was born on August 25, 1935. Her ID is '1786920f-c6fd-4fa7-a0dc-70a5ccc1fc79', and her `tau_o` value is 0.

4. An edge of type ALLERGIC_TO connects the patient to the ingredient `chlorthalidone`, with properties indicating no error (`is_error`: '1') but no specified start or stop dates for the allergy, and a `tau_o` value of 0.

5. Another edge shows that the patient takes the medication "Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet", starting on November 5, 1956, and stopping on November 11, 1957, with a `tau_o` value of 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
