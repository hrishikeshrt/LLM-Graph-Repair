The first repair suggests that the tau_o value for oxycodone (Node ID: 6757) is incorrect, so we update its tau_o value to 0. We also remove the relationship between oxycodone and the medication since it is no longer an ingredient in the corrected graph.

The second repair suggests that the allergy information for the patient is incorrect, so we delete the existing 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship between the patient and oxycodone. We then create a new 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship with the correct start date (the patient's birthdate).

The third repair suggests that the tau_o value for the medication is incorrect, so we update it to 0. We also remove the error indicator from the 'HAS_INGREDIENT' relationship since it is no longer an error in the corrected graph.

The fourth repair suggests that the start date for the allergy of the patient is missing, so we add the correct start date (the patient's birthdate) to the 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship.
