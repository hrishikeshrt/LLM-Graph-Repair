Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

From the description, there are two relationships involving the ingredient 'oxycodone': one as a HAS_INGREDIENT and another as ALLERGIC_TO. That doesn't make sense because an ingredient shouldn't be both present in a medication and cause an allergy to itself. 

So, I need to remove the incorrect relationship. The ALLERGIC_TO relationship is wrong here because oxycodone isn't an allergen; it's a medication. Therefore, deleting that edge should fix the inconsistency.
