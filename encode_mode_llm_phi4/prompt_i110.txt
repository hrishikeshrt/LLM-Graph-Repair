        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is oxycodone, identified by its ID (e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757), which has a property `tau_o` set to 1. There is a medication described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" with an ID of (e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846). This medication has a code '205923', `tau_o` set to 1, and is connected to oxycodone by the relationship HAS_INGREDIENT, which also has an error status indicated by `is_error` being '1'.

The patient in this graph is identified as Sanford861 Fritsch593 with an ID of (e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840). The patient's details include a birthdate on June 22, 1923, and an address at '935 Rempel Trail'. The patient is allergic to oxycodone, as indicated by the ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient and oxycodone, with no error status (`is_error` being '0').

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
