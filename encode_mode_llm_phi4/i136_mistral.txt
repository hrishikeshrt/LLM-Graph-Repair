Explanation: The patient should not have taken the medication after becoming allergic to one of its ingredients. To fix this inconsistency, we update the end date of the `rm` relationship (takes_medication) to represent that Weldon459 Effertz744 stopped taking Verapamil Hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet after May 8, 1998. Additionally, we add a new relationship between the patient and medication node representing that he stopped taking the medication.
