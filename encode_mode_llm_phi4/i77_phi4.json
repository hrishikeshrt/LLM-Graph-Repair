  "content": "The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the fact that the patient, Walker122 Kuhic920, who was born on September 6, 1914, and deceased on March 19, 1977, is indicated as being allergic to an ingredient (epoetin alfa) while also taking a medication containing that same ingredient. This situation is logically inconsistent given the patient's death date.\n\nTo resolve this inconsistency, we should remove the relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to the ingredient, as it is not possible for a deceased individual to have an allergy.\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [ra] | -\n</repairs>",
