The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the fact that Samatha Mueller846 is allergic to Olmesartan, yet she takes a medication containing Olmesartan. This situation could potentially be harmful and should be addressed.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. The relationship indicating that Samatha is allergic to Olmesartan (ALLERGIC_TO) needs to be corrected or removed if it's incorrect.
2. Alternatively, the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship might need adjustment if it's inappropriate for her to take Tribenzor due to her allergy.

Assuming the allergy information is correct and Samatha should not be taking a medication containing Olmesartan, we suggest removing the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship:
