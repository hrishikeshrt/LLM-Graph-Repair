The patient's death date is incorrect and needs to be removed. Additionally, since the patient should not be taking the medication due to an allergy, we will update the patient-medication relationship to "PRESCRIBED_MEDICATION" instead of "TAKES_MEDICATION". The start time for this new relationship is set to the original start time of the "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship.
