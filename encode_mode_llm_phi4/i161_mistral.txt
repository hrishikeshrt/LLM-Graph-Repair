Explanation: In this case, the patient is allergic to ferrous sulfate but also taking a medication that contains it. To resolve the inconsistency, we either need to remove the allergy (which might not be appropriate in reality) or update the medication record to indicate an error. Since removing the allergy could potentially have serious consequences, we choose to mark the medication as an error instead.
