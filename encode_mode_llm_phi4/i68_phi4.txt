The inconsistency in this scenario arises from the fact that a patient, Walker122 Kuhic920, who lived between September 6, 1914, and March 19, 1977, is recorded as taking medication on October 4, 1972. This is inconsistent with the timeline of their life.

To resolve this inconsistency, we should remove the relationship indicating that the patient took the medication, as it is factually incorrect given the patient's lifespan.
