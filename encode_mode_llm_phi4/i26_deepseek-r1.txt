Okay, I need to figure out how to fix the inconsistency in the graph based on the given description. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, there are two nodes: "oxycodone" and "Epogen 4000 UNT/MLInjection". Both have a `tau_o` value of 1. The medication also has an error indicated by `is_error: '1'`, while the patient's allergy doesn't show any error, with `tau_o: 0`. 

Hmm, I think the issue is that both nodes are showing the same `tau_o` value, which might not be accurate for each specific case. The medication has an error, so maybe it shouldn't have a `tau_o` of 1 in this context.

I should probably remove the `tau_o: 1` property from "Epogen" because its relationship with the patient indicates an error. That way, only "oxycodone" retains its correct `tau_o` value.
