The inconsistency in the graph arises from the fact that the patient, Kendal125 Bartoletti50, is allergic to mestranol but is taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, which contains mestranol. This situation should be flagged as an error due to potential health risks.

To address this inconsistency:

1. Update the `is_error` property of the relationship between Humulin 70/30 and mestranol from '1' to '0', indicating that it is not an error for the medication to contain mestranol, but rather the patient's allergy to it should be flagged as problematic.

2. Update the `is_error` property of the relationship between the patient and mestranol (ALLERGIC_TO) from '0' to '1', flagging this as an actual error due to the potential risk posed by the patient taking a medication containing an allergen.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {is_error: 0}

UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {is_error: 1}
