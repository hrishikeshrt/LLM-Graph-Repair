The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the fact that the patient, Rosio404 Bayer639, is allergic to verapamil, which is an ingredient of the medication they are taking. This presents a potential health risk and should be flagged as an error.

To address this issue, we need to update the edge indicating the allergy to reflect the presence of an error correctly. The existing edge already has `is_error` set to `'1'`, but it would be prudent to ensure that this attribute is explicitly recognized in any system processing these relationships.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {is_error: '1'}
</repairs>

This operation ensures that the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient is correctly flagged as having an error, which aligns with the current data but makes it explicit for any processing logic.
