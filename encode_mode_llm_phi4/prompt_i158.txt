Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is ferrous sulfate (Node ID: 6691), which has the property `tau_o` set to 1. This ingredient is part of a medication known as "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet" (Node ID: 6750). The medication has a code '860975' and also shares the property `tau_o` set to 1.

There is an edge from the medication node to the ingredient node, indicating that the medication contains ferrous sulfate. This relationship is labeled as HAS_INGREDIENT and includes properties such as `tau_o` equal to 1 and `is_error` marked as '1'.

A patient named Isiah14 Fritsch593 (Node ID: 5589) resides at 690 Stark Vista and was born on January 6, 1951. The patient is connected to the ingredient node by an edge labeled ALLERGIC_TO. This relationship has `tau_o` set to 0 and `is_error` marked as '0', indicating no error.

Additionally, there is a connection from the patient node to the medication node through an edge labeled TAKES_MEDICATION. The patient started taking this medication on May 5, 2018, at 06:11:10 Zulu time and stopped on June 2, 2018, at the same time of day. This relationship has `tau_o` set to 0, with no error indicated.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
