Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. Specifically:

1. There is an ingredient identified as "oxycodone" with the ID `cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1`, which has a property `tau_o` set to 1.

2. A medication described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" is associated with this ingredient. This medication has the code '205923', a description, and also a `tau_o` value of 1. The relationship between the medication and the ingredient is defined by an edge labeled "HAS_INGREDIENT," which includes properties indicating it has an error (`is_error: '1'`) and a `tau_o` value of 1.

3. A patient named Logan Brekke, with the ID `cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1`, resides at "1081 Orn Street." The patient was born on May 30, 1913, and passed away on May 2, 2009. This patient is allergic to oxycodone, as indicated by an edge labeled "ALLERGIC_TO," with no error (`is_error: '0'`) and a `tau_o` value of 0.

4. The same patient was taking the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" starting and stopping on April 27, 2004, at 23:35:03 UTC. This relationship is defined by an edge labeled "TAKES_MEDICATION," with a `tau_o` value of 0 and no error (`is_error: '0'`).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
