Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        The graph describes a scenario involving a patient, a medication, and an ingredient. The node with ID `[4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6691]` represents `ferrous sulfate`, which is labeled as an `Ingredient`. Another node, `[4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6750]`, corresponds to a medication named "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet," identified by the code `860975` and labeled as `Medication`. The node `[4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840]` represents a patient, Sanford Fritsch861, who resides at 935 Rempel Trail and was born on June 22, 1923.

There are three edges connecting these nodes. The first edge `[5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51961]` indicates that the medication "24 HR Glucophage" `HAS_INGREDIENT` ferrous sulfate, with a property indicating an error (`is_error`: '1'). The second edge `[5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:980]` shows that the patient is `ALLERGIC_TO` ferrous sulfate, without any specified start or stop dates and no errors. Lastly, the third edge `[5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:748]` indicates that the patient `TAKES_MEDICATION` "24 HR Glucophage" from April 13, 2001, to June 15, 2001.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
