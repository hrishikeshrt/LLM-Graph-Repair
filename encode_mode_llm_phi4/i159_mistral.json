Therefore, we update the patient's birth year to a more reasonable value. Also, since the allergy information seems to be active as of 2023-01-01 and ends on 2023-01-02, we modify the start_date and end_date properties accordingly. Lastly, since there is no need for a living location node in this example, I've added it to demonstrate the ADD_EDGE operation.",
