        The graph describes a scenario involving three entities: an ingredient, a medication, and a patient. The ingredient is identified as oxycodone with the ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757'. It has a property indicating its tau_o value of 1.

The medication, labeled as Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, is identified by the code '205923' and has an ID 'e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846'. It also contains oxycodone as one of its ingredients. This relationship between the medication and the ingredient is marked with a property indicating tau_o value of 1, but it's noted that there is an error associated with this link (is_error: '1').

The patient, named Sanford Fritsch, has the ID '3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d'. His address is listed as 935 Rempel Trail, and he was born on June 22, 1923. The patient is allergic to oxycodone, although no specific start or stop dates are provided for this allergy (tau_o: 0), and there is no error associated with this relationship (is_error: '0').

Additionally, the patient takes the medication Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection starting and stopping on April 24, 2016, at 09:55:43 UTC. There are no errors associated with this medication-taking event (tau_o: 0).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
