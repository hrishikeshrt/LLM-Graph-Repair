The inconsistency in the graph arises from the fact that Logan Brekke, who is allergic to oxycodone, is also taking Epogen, which contains oxycodone. This situation should not occur as it poses a health risk.

To address this issue, we can consider removing the edge indicating that Logan Brekke takes Epogen, since he is allergic to one of its ingredients.
