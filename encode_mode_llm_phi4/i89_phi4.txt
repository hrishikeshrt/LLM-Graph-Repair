This repair operation removes the erroneous relationship indicating that the patient, Walker122 Kuhic920, is allergic to epoetin alfa. The inconsistency arises because the patient took a medication containing this ingredient without any recorded adverse reaction or allergy in the scenario described. Removing this edge corrects the factual error in the graph data.
