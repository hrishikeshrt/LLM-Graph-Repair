Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph describes a network involving an ingredient, medication, and a patient. The ingredient is identified as oxycodone ([6757]) with a property tau_o of 1. There is a medication called Epogen with the code '205923', described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" and also has a tau_o value of 1 ([6846]). A patient named Logan Brekke, born on May 30, 1913, residing at 1081 Orn Street, who passed away on May 2, 2009, is part of this network ([6203]).

The medication Epogen contains the ingredient oxycodone, as indicated by an edge labeled HAS_INGREDIENT with a property tau_o of 1 and marked as an error (is_error: '1'). Logan Brekke is allergic to oxycodone, shown by an edge labeled ALLERGIC_TO without any start or stop dates for the allergy and has a tau_o value of 0. Additionally, Logan Brekke takes the medication Epogen from February 12, 2008, at 23:35:03 UTC, as indicated by an edge labeled TAKES_MEDICATION with matching start and stop times and a tau_o value of 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
