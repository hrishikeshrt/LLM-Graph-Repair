        The graph describes a scenario involving a patient, an ingredient, and a medication. The patient, Logan Brekke496 (ID: cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1), was born on May 30, 1913, lived at 1081 Orn Street, and passed away on May 2, 2009. This patient is allergic to an ingredient identified as oxycodone (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757). Additionally, the patient was taking a medication described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" with code 205923 (ID: e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846), starting and stopping on June 26, 2004. The ingredient oxycodone is part of this medication. There are indications that the allergy information might contain an error, while the medication-taking record does not have such an issue.
