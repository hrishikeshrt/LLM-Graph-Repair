The inconsistency in this graph pattern arises from the fact that the patient, Logan Brekke, who passed away on May 2, 2009, is taking a medication starting and stopping on April 19, 2005. This implies an impossible scenario where the patient is alive during the medication period but has already died according to their birth and death dates.

To address this inconsistency, we should remove the relationship indicating that Logan Brekke took Epogen, as it contradicts the known fact of his death date.
