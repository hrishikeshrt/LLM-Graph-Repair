      UPD_NODE | [i] | {ingredient: "not metformin"}
      ADD_EDGE | [p, i] | {allergic_to: false}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the ingredient property of the Ingredient node to a value other than 'metformin' and adding an edge between the Patient node and the updated Ingredient node with `allergic_to` set to false. This change will remove Teddy976 Cremin516's allergy to metformin, as stated in the description.
