Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are two main issues:

1. **Error in the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship**: The edge between Epogen and oxycodone has an error property set to 1. This means that the system knows something is wrong with this association, but it shouldn't be the case because the medication does contain oxycodone.

2. **Correct allergy information for oxycodone**: The patient is correctly marked as allergic to oxycodone (is_error = 0), which makes sense since oxycodone is an opioid and can cause severe allergies, especially in certain patients like Sanford861 Fritsch593.

So the first step is to fix the error in the HAS_INGREDIENT edge. Since this edge incorrectly states that there's a problem with the ingredient, I should remove the error property from it. This will make the graph accurate because the medication actually does contain oxycodone as an ingredient without any issues.

Next, looking at the allergy information, since it's correct, there's no need to change anything there. The patient being allergic is already properly represented in the graph.

I don't see any other inconsistencies mentioned, so I won't need to add or remove any nodes or edges beyond fixing that one error.
