The first repair operation updates the `rc` edge connecting the ingredient node to the medication node, correcting the incorrect ingredient name from ferrous sulfate to ferric sulfate. The second repair operation removes the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient node. This is necessary because a patient who takes a medication containing an allergen should not have an allergy to that allergen.
