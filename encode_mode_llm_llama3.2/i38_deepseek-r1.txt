Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are two medications linked to the patient: verapamil hydrochloride and naproxen. The problem is that both of these are connected through the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship, which isn't correct because each medication should have its own set of ingredients.

Looking at the graph query, I see that both verapamil and naproxen are linked to the same ingredient via [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]. That's a mistake because each medication has different ingredients. So, we need to separate these relationships.

First, I'll check if the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship exists for each medication individually. If it does, then we should remove those existing ones and add new ones specific to each medication.

So, my plan is:
1. Remove the existing HAS_INGREDIENT relationships from the medication nodes.
2. Add new HAS_INGREDIENT edges pointing to their respective ingredients.

This way, each medication will correctly reference its unique set of ingredients without overlapping with another medication's information.

I'll use ADD_EDGE and DEL_EDGE operations for this. I need to make sure that after removing the old edges, I add the correct ones for both verapamil and naproxen.

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
ADD_EDGE | [rm] | {HAS_INGREDIENT: 'verapamil hydrochloride'}
ADD_EDGE | [rc] | {HAS_INGREDIENT: 'naproxen'}
