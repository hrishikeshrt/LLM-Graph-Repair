The inconsistency in this scenario involves a patient's ID being used as an address. The node representing the patient has an ID of `oxycodone`, which should not be an address property but rather a unique identifier for the patient.

To fix this, we need to update the properties of the patient node:

UPD_NODE | [p] | {id: "4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93", address: "1081 Orn Street", birthdate: "May 30, 1913"}
