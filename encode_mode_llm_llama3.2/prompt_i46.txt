Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's information. [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] is the patient ID, identified as "Rosio404" and born in 1914. The patient lives at address "[856 Carroll Center Apt 22]".

The patient is taking a medication called [897718], which is verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet. This information was last updated on [2000-09-05]. The patient was prescribed this medication due to a medical condition, as indicated by the label "Medication".

Interestingly, the patient has an allergy to another medication with the same ID, [897718], which is also verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet. This information suggests that the patient's system may have encountered an error while processing this medication.

Furthermore, the patient was previously prescribed a different medication with the same ID, [897718], which is also verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet. However, the start and stop dates for taking this medication are unclear due to errors in the system, indicated by "tau_o" values of 0.

The graph does not provide any information on the patient's current status or whether they have stopped taking the medication.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.

</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
