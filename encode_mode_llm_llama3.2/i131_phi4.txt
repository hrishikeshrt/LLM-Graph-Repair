The inconsistency lies in the fact that a node labeled as "Ingredient" has been incorrectly assigned properties of a medication, specifically having a medication code for Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet. This suggests that either the node was mislabeled or it is intended to be a Medication node but is currently an Ingredient node.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. **Correct the Node Label**: Change the label from "Ingredient" to "Medication".
2. **Remove Incorrect Properties**: Ensure that any properties specific to medications (like medication code) are correctly assigned, and remove them if they exist on an incorrectly labeled node.

Here is the suggested repair operation:

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | [i] | { :Medication }
</repairs>

This operation updates the label of the node `[i]` from "Ingredient" to "Medication", correcting the inconsistency in the graph.
