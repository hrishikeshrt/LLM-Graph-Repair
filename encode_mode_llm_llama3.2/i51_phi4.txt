The inconsistency identified is that a patient is both taking warfarin and allergic to it. This situation is contradictory because a person should not be prescribed a medication they are allergic to.

To resolve this, we can remove the relationship indicating the patient takes warfarin since being allergic to it would prevent its prescription.
