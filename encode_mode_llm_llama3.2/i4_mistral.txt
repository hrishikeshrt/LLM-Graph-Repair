   The first repair operation updates the Ingredient node with the correct description. It also adds a new relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes to reflect the allergy, starting from 1993.

   The second repair operation updates the Medication node with the correct code, name, prescription start date, and end date.

   The third repair operation adds a new relationship between the Medication and Ingredient nodes to indicate that the medication has an unknown ingredient. This is necessary because the initial graph shows that the patient takes a medication containing exemestane, but the medication node does not have any ingredients associated with it.
