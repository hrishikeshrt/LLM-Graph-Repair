Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's medical information. The node with ID [19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b] is labeled as a "Patient" and has the following properties: address, birthdate, and more. 

There are two medication nodes connected to this patient: one labeled as "Medication" with code [205923], description, and other properties, and another labeled as "Ingredient" with properties related to an ingredient. The patient is taking the medication from the second node.

The patient has a medical condition that causes them to be allergic to certain ingredients (the relationship between the two nodes). 

The patient also takes the medication at specific times: they started taking it on [1975-06-27T09:30:42Z] and stopped before taking another dose.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
