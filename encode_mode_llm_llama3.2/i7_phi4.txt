The inconsistency arises from the fact that the patient, Earle679, has an "ALLERGIC_TO" relationship with a medication they are taking. This suggests either an error in documenting allergies or medications.

To address this:

1. Remove the incorrect "ALLERGIC_TO" relationship between the patient and the medication.
2. Ensure the medication type is correctly labeled as HCTZ, not exemestane.
