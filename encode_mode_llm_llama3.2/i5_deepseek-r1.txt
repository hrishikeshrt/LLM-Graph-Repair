Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are two main issues:

1. **Missing allergy information**: The patient has an allergy to an ingredient, but there's no specific details provided about what that ingredient is.
2. **Redundant relationship**: There's a relationship between the patient's address and their medication info because they were last seen at a specific location.

Looking at the graph query:

- The patient (p) takes a medication (rm), which has an ingredient (rc).
- The patient also has an allergy to an ingredient (i).

The problem is that we don't know what the allergen is, and there's no link between the address and the medication info.

For the first issue, since we don't have any details about the allergen, maybe it's best to remove the allergy relationship. That way, we avoid having an undefined ingredient in the graph.

For the second issue, the patient was last seen at Kilback Center Unit 20 on a specific date. This information should be linked to the patient node so that it's clear where they were last seen.

So, I'll suggest deleting the allergy relationship (rc) and adding two new relationships: one between the patient and the address location, and another between the patient and the medication info with the address details.

DEL_RELATIONSHIP | [rc] | -
ADD_RELATIONSHIP | [patient] <- {address: "Kilback Center Unit 20", location_date: "2018-01-23"} |
ADD_RELATIONSHIP | (p) -> {address_info: "Kilback Center Unit 20"}
