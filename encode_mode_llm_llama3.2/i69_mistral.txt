Explanation: The patient is allergic to Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, but the medication has not been resolved. We update the allergy status of the patient-allergy relationship to resolved and remove the allergy from the patient's properties. Since the graph states that the patient took the medication since 1973-03-30T09:30:42Z, we assume there is an error in the information about the medication or the ingredients. We add a new node for the Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection medication and update its relationship with the patient (rm). Since the graph only mentions one ingredient, we also add a new node for another potential ingredient and update the relationship with the medication (rc). This will allow further investigation to identify the inconsistency.
