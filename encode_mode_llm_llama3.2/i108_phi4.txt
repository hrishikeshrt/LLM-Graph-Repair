The inconsistency described involves a patient who takes a medication and is also allergic to an ingredient in that medication. Specifically, the patient is taking Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection (which does not contain oxycodone) but is marked as allergic to oxycodone.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to ensure that the allergy information accurately reflects the ingredients of the medications the patient takes. Since oxycodone is not an ingredient in Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, the "ALLERGIC_TO" relationship between the patient and the oxycodone node should be removed.
