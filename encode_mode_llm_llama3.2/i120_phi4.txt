Explanation of the repairs:
- `ADD_NODE` is used to create a new Medication node with the correct properties.
- `UPD_NODE` updates the existing node's properties to be consistent with its role as a Patient.
- A new `Patient` node is added for clarity and separation of roles.
- `DEL_EDGE` removes incorrect relationships that imply a single node can simultaneously fulfill multiple roles (Medication, Ingredient, Patient).
