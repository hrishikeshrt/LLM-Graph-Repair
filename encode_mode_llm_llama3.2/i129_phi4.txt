The inconsistency arises because a node labeled as "Ingredient" contains properties related to medication and patient details, which should not be part of an Ingredient node. The following repairs address this issue:

1. Remove the incorrect properties from the Ingredient node.
2. Add a new Medication node with the correct properties.
