Given the inconsistency, I suggest the following repairs:

<repairs>
ADD_NODE | [i] | {name: 'oxycodone', type: 'controlled substance'}
ADD_EDGE | [rm] | {medication_code: 205923}
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>

These repairs address the inconsistency by adding a new node for the ingredient "oxycodone" with its properties, and then adding an edge from the patient to this new node representing the medication they take. Finally, removing the existing edge from the patient to the original ingredient node resolves the inconsistency.
