Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's medical information. The nodes are labeled as [Patient], [Medication], and [Ingredient]. The node with ID [mestranol] is associated with the medication [Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension].

The patient, identified by ID [cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1], has a birthdate of May 30, 1913, and died on May 2, 2009. The patient's address is located at Orn Street.

There are three edges connecting the nodes: one indicating that the medication [Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension] contains the ingredient [mestranol], another showing that the patient is allergic to [Ingredient], and a third stating that the patient takes the medication on specific dates.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
