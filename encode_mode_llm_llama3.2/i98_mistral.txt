   In this case, the patient's birth date and death date are correct but not represented as properties of the Patient node. The address is also missing. We add a new Address node for the patient's address and update the Patient node with the birth date, death date, and address. The allergy information is incorrect, so we update the stop_date of the allergy relationship to the patient's death date. Lastly, since the medication ingredient is not accurate, we remove the relationship between the Ingredient and Medication nodes.
