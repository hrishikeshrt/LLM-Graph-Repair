    UPD_NODE | 6757 | {label: "Medication", code: "205923"}
    DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
```

Explanation of the repairs:
- The node with ID 6757 is incorrectly labeled as `Ingredient` when it should be a `Medication`. It represents oxycodone, which has a specific medication code. Therefore, we update its label and add the correct medication code.
- There is an incorrect relationship `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]` from the oxycodone medication node (6757) to itself as an ingredient. Since oxycodone should not have itself listed as an ingredient, this edge needs to be removed.
