Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The query matches a patient (p) who takes medication (rm), which has an ingredient (rc). There's also an edge from p to i with label ALLERGIC_TO, meaning the patient is allergic to the ingredient. But looking at the details provided, the patient isn't allergic to any ingredientsâ€”they just took a medication that includes an ingredient.

So, in the graph, there are two edges between p and i: one labeled ALLERGIC_TO and another labeled rm with the ingredient as a tablet. This duplication is causing the inconsistency because the patient doesn't have an allergy; they just take the medication.

I need to remove the incorrect edge that's labeled ALLERGIC_TO since it's not accurate. That way, only the correct medication information remains in the graph.
