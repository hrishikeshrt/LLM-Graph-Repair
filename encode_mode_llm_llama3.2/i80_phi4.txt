The inconsistency arises from the fact that the patient has an allergy to a medication, but there is no record of any ingredients in their medical history. Additionally, there is a `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the patient and the medication, which should not exist as it implies direct prescription rather than ingredient association.

To resolve these issues:

1. Remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the medication.
2. Remove the incorrect `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the patient and the medication.
