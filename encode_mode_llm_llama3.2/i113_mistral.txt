This set of repairs addresses the inconsistencies in the graph by updating the patient's birth date, adding a node for the death date (with an empty value), setting the correct medication code and name, administration, start and end dates for Epogen 4003 UNT/ML Injection, and adding an allergy edge for oxycodone with an unspecified start date.
