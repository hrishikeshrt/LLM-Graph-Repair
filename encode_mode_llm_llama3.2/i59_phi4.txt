This operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient and ferrous sulfate. This ensures that the graph accurately reflects the allergy constraint by preventing the patient from taking a medication they are allergic to. Further clinical review would be necessary to determine an alternative treatment for the patient's condition.
