The inconsistency described involves a single node having three labels: "Ingredient", "Medication", and "Patient". This is factually inaccurate because a node should not simultaneously represent an Ingredient, Medication, and Patient. The node should only have one label that correctly represents its role in the graph.

To resolve this issue, we need to separate these roles into distinct nodes while maintaining the correct relationships between them. Here are the suggested repairs:

1. **Remove the "Patient" label from the node** since it incorrectly represents a patient.
2. **Add a new "Patient" node** with the appropriate properties.
3. **Create edges** to connect this new "Patient" node to the existing "Medication" and "Ingredient" nodes.

UPD_NODE | [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] | {labels: ["Ingredient", "Medication"]}
ADD_NODE | (new_patient) | {address: "original_address", birthdate: "original_birthdate", ID: "original_ID"}
ADD_EDGE | (new_patient)-[:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m) | -
ADD_EDGE | (new_patient)-[:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i) | -
</repairs>

Note: Replace `"original_address"`, `"original_birthdate"`, and `"original_ID"` with the actual properties from the original "Patient" node.
