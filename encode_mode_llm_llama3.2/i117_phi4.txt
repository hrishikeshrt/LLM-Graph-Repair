Based on the provided description, there are a few inconsistencies that need to be addressed:

1. **Dosage for Oxycodone**: The dosage for oxycodone is not specified.
2. **Allergy Treatment Status**: There is no indication of whether the allergy to epogen is being treated.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | m:Medication {name: 'oxycodone'} | {dosage: 'specified_dosage'}
</repairs>

<repairs>
ADD_EDGE | (p:Patient)-[rt:TREATS_ALLERGY]->(i:Ingredient {name: 'epogen'}) | -
</repairs> 

These operations address the missing dosage information for oxycodone and add a relationship to indicate that the allergy is being treated. Adjust `specified_dosage` with the actual dosage value if available.
