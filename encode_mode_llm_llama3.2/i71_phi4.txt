The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that the patient Walker122 has a relationship indicating an allergy to epoetin alfa, which is an ingredient of the medication Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. However, it is stated that the patient has no known allergies to this medication.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the incorrect `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between Walker122 and the ingredient epoetin alfa.
