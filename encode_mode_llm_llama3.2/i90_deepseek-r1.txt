Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what's going on here.

First, there are two edges from node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203 to node :6776. One edge is labeled [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] and the other is [ra:ALLERGIC_TO]. That seems odd because a patient shouldn't both take a medication and be allergic to it at the same time, especially since the medication has an ingredient that's also making them allergic.

Wait, but looking closer, the node in question is labeled as both "Patient" and "Ingredient". It's acting as an ingredient in one relationship and as an allergen in another. That might not make sense because a patient can't be an ingredient of themselves or someone else. Also, the medication has an ingredient that's making them allergic, which seems contradictory.

So maybe we need to split this node into two separate nodes: one for the Patient and another for the Ingredient. But since the node already exists with both labels, perhaps we should remove the "Patient" label so it can just be an Ingredient. That way, the allergy edge makes sense because the ingredient is causing the allergy.

Alternatively, maybe the patient shouldn't have an edge indicating they're allergic to something if they are taking that medication. So removing that edge could fix the inconsistency too.
