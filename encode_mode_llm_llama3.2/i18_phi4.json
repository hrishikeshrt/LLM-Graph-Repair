This suggests a potential error in either the medication or allergy information.\n\nTo resolve this inconsistency:\n\n1. Remove the relationship indicating the patient is allergic to oxycodone if it's incorrect.\n2. Alternatively, remove the relationship indicating the patient takes oxycodone if that's incorrect.\n\nAssuming the allergy information is correct and the issue lies with the medication intake:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rm] | -\n</repairs>\n\nIf further investigation reveals the opposite (the allergy is incorrect), then:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [ra] | -\n</repairs>",
