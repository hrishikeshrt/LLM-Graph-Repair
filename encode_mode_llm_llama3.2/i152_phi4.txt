Explanation of the repairs:
- The inconsistency arises because there are no ingredients listed for Metformin, yet the query indicates that Teddy976 is allergic to none of the ingredients. To resolve this, we add a placeholder ingredient node and an edge from Metformin to this ingredient.
- This ensures that the graph structure reflects the presence of at least one ingredient, aligning with the description that there are no allergies to any ingredients (since they exist).
