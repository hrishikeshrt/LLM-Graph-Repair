This repair suggests updating the ingredient node to have no label and removing the relationship between the medication and the ingredient. The reasoning behind this is that oxycodone, being an oral medication, cannot be an injection or an ingredient in another medication. Additionally, if a patient is not allergic to a medication, it should not be associated with the "ALLERGIC_TO" relationship for that patient.
