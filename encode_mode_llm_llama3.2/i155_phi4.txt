The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the patient being both taking a medication and having an allergy to it. This suggests that either the allergy or the medication-taking relationship is incorrect.

To resolve this, we can consider two possible repairs:

1. If the patient should not be allergic to the ingredient (ferrous sulfate) present in the medication they are taking, remove the allergy relationship.
2. If the patient should not be taking the medication due to their allergy, remove the medication-taking relationship.

Given these options, here is a suggested repair assuming the allergy information is incorrect:

Alternatively, if it's determined that the patient should not take the medication due to the allergy:
