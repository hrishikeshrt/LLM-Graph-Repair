This is a factual inconsistency because a patient should not be prescribed a medication to which they have an allergy.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we can remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes oxycardone:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rm] | -\n</repairs> \n\nThis operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient and oxycodone, ensuring that the graph accurately reflects the patient's allergy to this medication.",
