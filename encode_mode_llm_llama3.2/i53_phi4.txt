Explanation of the suggested repairs:
- The `Ingredient` node incorrectly contains patient information. A new `Patient` node is created with the correct properties.
- An edge from the newly created `Patient` node to the `Medication` node is added, representing the medication taken by the patient.
- A new `Medication` node is created for Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet.
- The existing incorrect `Ingredient` node should only represent warfarin. Therefore, a new `Ingredient` node with the correct name "warfarin" is created.
- An edge from the newly created `Patient` node to the new `Ingredient` node is added to reflect the patient's allergy to warfarin.
