Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's medical information. The patient is identified by the ID [cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1]. The patient's name is Logan497, and they were born on May 30th, 1913. They reside at address [1081 Orn Street].

The patient has a medical condition related to the medication oxycodone ([oxycodone]), which is identified by ID [6757]. The oxycodone was prescribed with code [205923] and has a description of "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection".

The patient takes this medication, as indicated by the edge labeled [TAKES_MEDICATION] between the patient's node and the oxycodone's node. The start date for taking the medication is September 18th, 2008.

Additionally, the patient has an allergy to the oxycodone, which is represented by the edge labeled [ALLERGIC_TO] between the patient's node and the oxycodone's node. However, this relationship does not have a start or stop date associated with it.

The graph also indicates that the oxycodone contains the ingredient "Ingredient", as specified in the properties of the oxycodone's node.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
