The inconsistency lies in the fact that the patient, Logan497, is both taking a medication containing oxycodone and being allergic to it. This suggests an error in either the allergy or medication information.

To resolve this, we need to determine whether the patient should not be taking the medication due to their allergy. Assuming the allergy information is correct, the logical repair would be to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing oxycodone.
