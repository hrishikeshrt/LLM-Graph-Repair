The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves a patient, Sanford861, who has an allergy to clopidogrel. The medication Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet contains clopidogrel as an ingredient, and the patient is taking this medication despite having an allergy to one of its ingredients.

To address this inconsistency factually:

1. **Remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication** since it would be unsafe for a patient with an active allergy to take a medication containing that allergen.
