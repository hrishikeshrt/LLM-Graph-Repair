Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix the inconsistency in the given graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The graph shows a patient named Walker122 who took Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which contains Epoetin alfa. The issue is that the medication's start date is April 19, 1968, but the end date isn't specified. However, the patient died on March 19, 1977, so logically, the medication should have ended before or on that date.

Looking at the graph structure, there are two relationships: [rm] from Patient to Medication and [rc] from Medication to Ingredient Epoetin alfa. The problem is with the duration of the medication administration. Since the medication was taken until the patient's death, we need to adjust the end date.

I think the best approach is to remove the [rm] relationship because if the patient died before completing their medication course, there might be no record of taking it after that point. Alternatively, setting an explicit end date on the medication record would make it clearer.

So, I'll suggest removing the [rm] edge between Patient and Medication. This action will clean up the graph by eliminating any unnecessary or missing data points beyond the patient's lifespan.
