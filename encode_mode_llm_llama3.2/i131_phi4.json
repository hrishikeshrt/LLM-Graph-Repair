  "content": "The inconsistency lies in the fact that a node labeled as \"Ingredient\" has been incorrectly assigned properties of a medication, specifically having a medication code for Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet. This suggests that either the node was mislabeled or it is intended to be a Medication node but is currently an Ingredient node.\n\nTo resolve this inconsistency:\n\n1. **Correct the Node Label**: Change the label from \"Ingredient\" to \"Medication\".\n2. **Remove Incorrect Properties**: Ensure that any properties specific to medications (like medication code) are correctly assigned, and remove them if they exist on an incorrectly labeled node.\n\nHere is the suggested repair operation:\n\n<repairs>\nUPD_NODE | [i] | { :Medication }\n</repairs>\n\nThis operation updates the label of the node `[i]` from \"Ingredient\" to \"Medication\", correcting the inconsistency in the graph.",
