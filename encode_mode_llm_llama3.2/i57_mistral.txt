   To clarify, the patient's allergy information is missing, so we add a new allergen node and update the patient node with an allergy property. We also need to add the ingredient for the medication as it is currently missing from the graph. The new ingredient node is given the name "Fluticasone Propionate" since this is the active ingredient in Flovent 0.044 MG/ACTUAT Metered Dose Inhaler. The form property is set to "Inhalation Powder" as this is a common form for inhaled medications.
