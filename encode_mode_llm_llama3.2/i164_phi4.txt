The inconsistency described involves a patient being both taking medication and allergic to an ingredient within that same medication. This situation suggests a potential health risk, as patients should not be prescribed medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.

To resolve this issue, the relationship indicating the allergy (`ra:ALLERGIC_TO`) between the patient and the ingredient should be removed. This operation assumes that the allergy information is incorrect or outdated, and it addresses the immediate inconsistency in the graph by eliminating the conflicting data.
