   The suggested repairs address the inconsistencies in the graph. The patient's details are updated with their correct birthdate and address. A new node for the medication Tribenzor is added, along with its ingredients. Relationships between the patient and the medication, as well as the medication and its ingredients, are established. The allergy relationship is removed since it contradicts the patient taking the medication in question.
