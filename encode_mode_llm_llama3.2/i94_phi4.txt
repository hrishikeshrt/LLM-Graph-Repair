Explanation:
- The node with ID 'mestranol' is incorrectly labeled as both an Ingredient and a Medication. It should be updated to only have the Medication label with its correct properties.
- The relationships where this node takes medication, has an ingredient, or is allergic to itself are incorrect and need to be removed.
