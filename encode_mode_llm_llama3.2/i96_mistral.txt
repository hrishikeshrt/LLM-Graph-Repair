      UPD_NODE | [p] | {"allergy": true}
      DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
   </repairs>

The first repair operation updates the patient node with an allergy property set to true, as it seems that the patient is allergic to at least one ingredient. The second repair operation deletes the edge between the patient and the ingredient node, since the patient should not have an association with any ingredient if they are allergic.
