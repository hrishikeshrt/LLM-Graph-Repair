Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        The graph represents a patient's information. The patient is identified by [19d2cfb8-439b-454a-b47e-5274c219005b] and has an address at [524 Brekke Dale Suite 9]. The patient was born on [1914-09-06] and died on [1977-03-19].

The patient is prescribed the medication [205923], which is a type of epoetin alfa. Epoetin alfa is used to treat anemia, and it has the label [Ingredient]. The prescription details are as follows: code [205923], dosage 1 ML per unit, and injection.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
