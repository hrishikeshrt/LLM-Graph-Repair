The inconsistency in this scenario involves a patient being both taking a medication and being allergic to an ingredient within that medication. This suggests a potential safety issue or data entry error, as patients are generally advised against consuming medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.

To address the inconsistency:

1. **Remove the relationship indicating the patient is allergic to the ingredient found in their medication** if this allergy information is incorrect.
2. If the allergy information is accurate and should not be removed, consider updating the medication regimen or consulting a healthcare professional for alternative treatments that do not contain the allergen.

Assuming the allergy information is correct and needs addressing:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

If it turns out the allergy information was entered incorrectly and should not exist:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs> 

In both cases, the operation involves removing the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient.
