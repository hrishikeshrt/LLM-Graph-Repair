Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

We have a patient who was prescribed Epogen on June 22, 1923, but according to another record, Oxycodone was prescribed by February 21, 2013. That's clearly conflicting because a patient can't be prescribed two different medications at vastly different times unless there's some mistake.

Looking at the graph structure, the relationships between Patient (p), Medication (m), and Ingredient (i) are set up with rm for takes medication, rc for has ingredient, and ra for allergic to. 

The issue here is that the same patient p is connected via rm to m:Epogen, which then connects to i:1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. But there's also a connection from p to i through Oxycodone, which doesn't make sense because the dates don't align.

So, I think the problem is that the medication code in the rm relationship is wrong. Instead of Epogen, it should be Oxycodone since that's what was prescribed on February 21, 2013. 

To fix this, I need to update the property of the rm edge from "Epogen" to "Oxycodone". That way, the correct medication is linked to the patient.

I don't think we need to add or remove any nodes because all involved are already present. The only change needed is modifying the existing edge's property.
