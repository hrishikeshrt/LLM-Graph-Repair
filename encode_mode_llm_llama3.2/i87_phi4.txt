The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that the patient is both taking a medication and being allergic to it, with the allergy starting and stopping on the same date as when the medication was taken. This suggests an error in either the medication administration or allergy record.

To resolve this, we should consider removing the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication, assuming the primary concern is the recorded allergy.
