Based on the provided description, there are two main inconsistencies:

1. The patient has an allergy to a medication they are currently taking.
2. There is a "HAS_INGREDIENT" relationship between the patient and oxycodone, which should be between the medication and its ingredient.

To address these issues:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc: HAS_INGREDIENT] | -
</repairs>

<repairs>
ADD_EDGE | (m) -[:HAS_INGREDIENT]-> (i) | -
</repairs> 

These operations remove the incorrect allergy relationship and correct the "HAS_INGREDIENT" relationship to be between the medication and its ingredient.
