The inconsistency lies in the fact that the patient, identified by an ID of "oxycodone," has an allergy to oxycodone while also taking it. This suggests a potential error in either the medication or allergy information.

To resolve this inconsistency:

2. Alternatively, remove the relationship indicating the patient takes oxycodone if that's incorrect.

Assuming the allergy information is correct and the issue lies with the medication intake:
