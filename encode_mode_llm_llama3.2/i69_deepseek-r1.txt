Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's start by understanding what's going on here.

The graph has a patient who was born in 1914 and died in 1977. The medication they're prescribed is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, with code 205923. It says the patient has taken this medication multiple times. There's also an allergy to this medication noted first in 1973 and still present today.

Wait a minute, if the patient died in 1977, how can they have an allergy that was identified after their death? That doesn't make sense. The allergy information is conflicting because it happened after the patient's death.

Looking at the graph structure: the patient has relationships with medication, which then relates to ingredients. There are two edges here: rm (TAKES_MEDICATION) and rc (HAS_INGREDIENT). Also, there's an ALLERGIC_TO relationship between patient and ingredient.

So, the issue is that the allergy was recorded after the patient's death. Therefore, the 'rc' edge showing the allergy should be removed because it's impossible for a patient who has already died to have an allergy.

I think deleting the rc edge would fix this inconsistency.
