Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's information. The patient is identified as [Logan497] and has an address at [1081 Orn Street]. The patient was born on May 30, 1913, and died on May 2, 2009.

There are two medications associated with the patient: Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which has a code of "205923", and oxycodone. Oxycodone is an ingredient in Epogen.

The patient takes medication for Epogen, and there is a specific start and stop date for this medication (January 19, 2001). The patient does not have any allergies to the ingredients in their medications.

Note: The graph also contains a death date, but it is unclear if this information is relevant or just redundant.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
