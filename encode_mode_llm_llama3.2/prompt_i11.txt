Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        This graph represents a patient's medical information. The node with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] is the patient, identified by their unique identifier [id='cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1']. The patient's name is Logan497 and they were born on May 30, 1913. They passed away on May 2, 2009.

The node has three labels: 'Patient', 'Medication' (with a specific code [code='205923']), and 'Ingredient'. The medication is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which the patient took from October 30, 2008, to an unknown end date. The ingredient in question is oxycodone.

There are three edges connecting the patient node to other nodes: one indicating that the patient has taken the medication [TAKES_MEDICATION], another showing that the medication contains the ingredient [HAS_INGREDIENT], and a third suggesting that the patient is allergic to the medication's ingredient [ALLERGIC_TO].

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
