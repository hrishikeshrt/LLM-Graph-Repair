Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's medical record. 
Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] belongs to the class of patients. 
It has an ingredient label, which is [frozenset({'Ingredient'})], and a medication label with code 106892 for Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension.
The patient's address is 208 Kilback Center Unit 20, their birthdate is May 7, 1917, and they last visited on January 23, 2018. 
They are also associated with an ingredient [frozenset({'Ingredient'})] and have taken medication at some point.
The edges in the graph show relationships between the patient's labels: 
the patient is allergic to no ingredients, but has taken medication from May 7, 2001 to June 18, 2001.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
