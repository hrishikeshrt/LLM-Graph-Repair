The first repair operation updates the patient node with correct properties for birthdate, first name, and last name. The second repair adds a new relationship between the patient and a Prescription node, indicating that the patient has an oxycodone prescription but without specifying the exact medication code, dosage, or frequency since those details are not provided in the description.
