This repair suggests updating the properties of the patient node with the correct birthdate and address, adding a new node for the ingredient Epoetin Alfa, updating the property of the allergy edge to reflect the correct date, and removing the incorrect relationship between the patient and Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection (since it is no longer necessary once we have added the ingredient node).
