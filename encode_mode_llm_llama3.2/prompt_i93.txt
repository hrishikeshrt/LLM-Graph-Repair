Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's medical information. The node with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] is associated with the patient, and it has three labels: Ingredient, Medication, and Patient.

The Medication label contains detailed information about a medication called Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension. It was prescribed to the patient and was taken from [start date] until [stop date].

Additionally, the graph indicates that the patient is allergic to certain ingredients in the medication. The allergy information includes a start date and an end date.

There is also an edge between the Medication label and the Ingredient label, indicating that the medication contains the ingredient.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
