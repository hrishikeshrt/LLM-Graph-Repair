Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's information. The node with ID [3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d] is labeled as a "Patient" and contains details such as address, birthdate, and identification number. 

There are two other nodes: one labeled as an "Ingredient" ([6757]) and another labeled as a "Medication" ([6846]). The "Ingredient" node has a code of [205923] and is associated with the patient through a relationship of being an ingredient in their medication.

The patient takes this medication, which is administered via injection. The medication's description includes information about its concentration and dosage. 

There are also relationships between these nodes: the patient is allergic to the medication (as indicated by the "ALLERGIC_TO" edge) and has taken it at some point (indicated by the "TAKES_MEDICATION" edge).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
