Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] is labeled as an "Ingredient" with ID [6700]. 

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] has two labels, one for a medication with code [897718], and another for a patient. The patient's details include address [856 Carroll Center Apt 22], birthdate [1914-09-05], and ID [b5581477-7033-4586-bc95-da6a508bdab6]. 

There is an edge connecting the medication node to the ingredient node with a key of [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:51919] and type "HAS_INGREDIENT". This indicates that the medication contains the ingredient. 

Another edge connects the patient node to the same ingredient node with a key of [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:975] and type "ALLERGIC_TO". This suggests that the patient is allergic to this ingredient. 

There is also an edge connecting the patient node to the medication node with a key of [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:782] and type "TAKES_MEDICATION". This indicates that the patient takes the specified medication.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
