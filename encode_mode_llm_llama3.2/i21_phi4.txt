The inconsistency in the graph pattern involves a patient being both taking a medication and being allergic to an ingredient of that same medication. Additionally, oxycodone is mentioned as an ingredient in the medication taken by the patient, which may not be accurate if it is only associated with another prescription.

To address these inconsistencies:

1. **Remove the relationship indicating the patient takes a medication they are allergic to**: If Logan497 is allergic to an ingredient of medication 205923, they should not take this medication.
2. **Verify and potentially remove incorrect ingredient associations**: Ensure that oxycodone is correctly associated with the medications.
