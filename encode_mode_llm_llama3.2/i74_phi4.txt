The inconsistency lies in Walker122 being both taking a medication and being allergic to an ingredient within that medication. This scenario suggests a potential oversight or error, as it's unusual for a patient to be prescribed a medication containing an allergen they are known to be allergic to.

To address this issue factually:

1. **Remove the relationship indicating Walker122 takes Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection** if it is confirmed that due to the allergy, the prescription should not exist.
2. Alternatively, if there's a valid reason for taking the medication despite the allergy (e.g., no alternative available and under medical supervision), ensure all relevant information is documented correctly.

Assuming the former scenario where the medication should not be prescribed:

If additional context or documentation suggests the prescription was intentional, consider updating the patient's record to reflect this decision with appropriate notes. However, based on the provided information, removing the relationship is a straightforward factual correction.
