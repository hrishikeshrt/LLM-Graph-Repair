Okay, so I'm trying to fix this inconsistency in a graph. Let me see what's going on here.

From the description, there are two main issues:

1. **Address and Location Link**: The patient has an address but no location data. They have a connection between their address and last known location, which isn't helpful because it doesn't provide any useful information.

2. **Allergy Information**: The patient is allergic to a substance in their medication. This allergy should be represented correctly in the graph so that it's linked appropriately with the medication.

First, I'll tackle the address and location issue. Since there's no relevant location data connected to the address, maybe we can remove that connection to clean up the graph without losing important allergy information.

Next, for the allergy, the current setup just links the patient to an ingredient without specifying which part of the ingredient is causing the allergy. So I think adding a specific property like `AllergyTo` would help clarify this relationship and make it easier to query or analyze later.

Putting it all together, I'll remove the address-to-location edge and add the allergy-specific relationship between the patient and the ingredient.
