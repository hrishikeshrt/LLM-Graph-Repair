   UPD_NODE | [i] | {name: "warfarin", allergenic: true}
   </repairs>
   The patient's allergy to warfarin is incorrect. To fix this, we update the properties of the Ingredient node (target: i) with a new key-value pair `{allergenic: true}` as it turns out that warfarin itself is an allergen for the patient. This repair operation does not require adding or removing any edges since the relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes already exists.
