The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the relationship `ALLERGIC_TO` between the patient and an ingredient that is also present as an ingredient (`HAS_INGREDIENT`) of a medication the patient takes. This suggests a logical contradiction, as it implies the patient is allergic to an ingredient they are currently taking.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the incorrect relationship indicating the allergy to the ingredient found in the medication the patient is taking.
