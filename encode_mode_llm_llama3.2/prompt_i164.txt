Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        This graph represents a patient's medical information. The nodes are labeled with unique identifiers and contain various properties such as birthdate, address, and medication details.

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6776] is associated with the label "Ingredient" and contains information about a medication, including its code and description. Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6786] has the label "Medication" and provides specific details about the medication, such as its code and description.

Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5979] is labeled with "Patient" and contains personal information about an individual, including their address, birthdate, and identification details.

There are three edges connecting these nodes. The edge between Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5979] and Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6776] indicates that the patient is allergic to a certain ingredient in the medication. The edge between Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5979] and Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6786] shows that the patient takes a specific medication, with start and stop dates for the treatment.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
