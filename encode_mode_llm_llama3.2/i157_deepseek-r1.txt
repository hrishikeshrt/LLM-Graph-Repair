Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the problem again.

The patient has a medication with an ingredient that's also their ID. That doesn't make sense because an ingredient can't be the same as the patient's ID. The patient's ID is 'i', and the medication's ingredient is also 'i'. So, I need to separate them.

First, maybe I should remove the edge connecting the medication to its ingredient. That way, they won't be connected anymore. Then, I can add a new node for the ingredient with the correct ID. This makes sense because each part of the patient's info should have unique nodes without overlapping properties.

So, I'll delete the [rc] relationship and then add a new node for the ingredient 'i' with its own details like name and code.

DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
ADD_NODE | (i_ingredient:Ingredient {id:"i"}) | {}
UPD_NODE | (i:Ingredient) | {id:"i", name:"Ferrous sulfate", code:"i_ingredient"}
