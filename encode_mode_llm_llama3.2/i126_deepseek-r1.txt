Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are three nodes: 6757, 6846, and 5840. Node 6757 is an oxycodone medication, which is an ingredient. Node 6846 is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, listed as a medication but also labeled as an Ingredient because of the rm relationship to the patient. That seems off.

Wait, the patient takes the medication from node 6757, so that makes senseâ€”oxycodone is an ingredient in the medication. But then why is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection both a medication and an ingredient? That's probably incorrect because medications don't typically have themselves as ingredients.

Looking at the relationships: p (the patient) takes rm, which points to 6757 (oxycodone). Then, the patient is allergic to Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. But since 6846 is labeled as a medication and also an ingredient because of the rm relationship, that's conflicting.

So node 6846 should not be both a medication and an ingredient. It should just be a medication. Therefore, I need to remove the 'Ingredient' property from it.

UPD_NODE | [6846] | {type: 'Medication', label: 'Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'}

The node labeled as an Ingredient should only be a medication.
