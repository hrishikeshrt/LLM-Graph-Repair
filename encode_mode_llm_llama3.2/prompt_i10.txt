Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's information. The node with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] corresponds to a patient, identified by the label [Medication], which is an oxycodone medication with code [205923]. The patient's address is located at [1081 Orn Street] and their birthdate is May 30, 1913. 

The node also contains other labels such as [Patient] and [Ingredient], but these are not directly related to the patient's information.

There is an edge from the patient node to another node with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] which represents a medication. The key of this edge is [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:901], indicating that the patient takes this medication, with start date March 7, 2003.

Another edge from the patient node to another node with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757] represents an ingredient in the medication. The key of this edge is [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036], indicating that the patient has a condition related to this ingredient, with tau_o equal to 1.

There is also an edge from the patient node to another node with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6203] which represents an allergic reaction. The key of this edge is [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:970], indicating that the patient has an allergy, with stop and start dates not specified.

Lastly, there is another edge from the patient node to another node with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757] which represents a medication. The key of this edge is [5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:970], indicating that the patient has a condition related to this ingredient, with tau_o equal to 0.

The node with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846] contains additional information about the medication, including its code and description.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
