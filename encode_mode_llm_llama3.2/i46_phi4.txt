The inconsistency arises from a patient being both taking and allergic to the same medication, which should not occur. Additionally, there are unclear start and stop dates for the medication.

To address these issues:

1. Remove the relationship indicating that the patient is taking the medication they are allergic to.
2. Update the properties of the existing `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship to clarify the start and stop dates.
