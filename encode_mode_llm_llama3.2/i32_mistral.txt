      UPD_NODE | [i] | {code: "oxycodone"}
      ADD_EDGE | [rc] | {ingredient: "{oxycodone}", quantity: "-"}
   </repairs>

   This repair suggests updating the ingredient node with the correct code "oxycodone" and adding a new relationship from the medication node to the ingredient node, indicating that the medication contains oxycodone. The quantity of the ingredient is set to "-", as the Cypher query does not provide this information.
