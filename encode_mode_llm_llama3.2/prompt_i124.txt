        This graph represents a patient's information. The node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] is identified as the patient, with details including name [Sanford861], address [935 Rempel Trail], birthdate [1923-06-22], and medication history.

The patient takes a medication called Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which has a code of [205923]. The patient is allergic to this medication and was prescribed it for treatment. 

The graph also indicates that the patient's current opioid prescription is oxycodone, with a specific ID [oxycodone] and dosage information not provided.

There are multiple relationships between the nodes in the graph: the patient takes Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection (Edge 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846), the patient is prescribed oxycodone (Edge 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757), and the patient is allergic to Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection (Edge 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5840 -> 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
