Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's medical information. The patient is identified by the node with ID [cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1]. 

This patient has taken medication, as indicated by the edge from [cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1] to [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6846], which is labeled as "TAKES_MEDICATION". The medication taken by the patient is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, identified by code [205923].

The patient has also been prescribed an opioid medication, oxycodone, with ID [oxycodone]. This relationship is established through another edge from [cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1] to [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757], labeled as "HAS_INGREDIENT".

Additionally, the patient has a known allergy to Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. This relationship is established through an edge from [cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1] to [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6757], labeled as "ALLERGIC_TO".

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
