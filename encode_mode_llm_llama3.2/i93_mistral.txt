   Here is the explanation for each repair operation:

1. The node with ID [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] should only have the Patient label, so we remove the Ingredient and Medication labels from it.

2. We remove the edge between the patient and the ingredient because a medication cannot be both an allergen and an active ingredient for the same patient.

3. Since the medication is now no longer associated with the patient as an active ingredient, we add a new edge between the patient and the ingredient to represent the allergy information. The start_date and end_date properties should be updated accordingly.

4. We also update the Medication node's labels to only include 'Medication'. This is because the node should not have any other labels besides 'Medication'.
