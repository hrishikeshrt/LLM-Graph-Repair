Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        This graph represents a patient's information. The node labeled [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] has three labels: "Ingredient", "Medication", and "Patient". 

The "Patient" label contains properties such as address, birthdate, and ID, which identify the patient. The "Medication" label contains a code and description for the medication taken by the patient, Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet.

There are three edges connecting this node to other nodes: one edge indicates that the patient is allergic to an ingredient (the key refers to another node with the same ID), another edge shows that the patient takes the medication, and a third edge shows that the patient has taken the medication at certain times.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
