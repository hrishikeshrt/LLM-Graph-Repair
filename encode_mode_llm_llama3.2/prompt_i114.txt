Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's information. The patient is identified as [3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d] and has the following details: their address is at 935 Rempel Trail, they were born on June 22, 1923, and their first name is Sanford. The patient takes medication for a medical condition.

The medication administered to the patient is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, with code 205923. This medication has an ingredient called oxycodone, which is a controlled substance.

There are two relationships between the patient and the medication: one is that the patient is allergic to the medication (due to the 'ALLERGIC_TO' edge), and another is that the patient takes the medication (due to the 'TAKES_MEDICATION' edge).

Note: The graph also contains a 'Patient' node with no edges, which represents the patient's identity information.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
