Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        Node [4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93] is labeled as an "Ingredient" and has the code "oxycodone". It also contains information about a patient, including their address and birthdate.

There is an edge connecting the node labeled as a "Medication", which has the code "205923" and details such as dosage and description. This medication is taken by the patient with the specified address and birthdate.

The patient node is connected to the ingredient node through an "ALLERGIC_TO" relationship, indicating that the patient is allergic to oxycodone. Additionally, there is a connection between the patient node and the medication node through a "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship, which indicates when the patient started taking the medication.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
