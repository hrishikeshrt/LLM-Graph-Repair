The inconsistency in this graph pattern arises from the fact that Sanford861, who has taken Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, is allergic to oxycodone. However, it's stated that Epogen contains the ingredient epogen (which matches oxycodone), suggesting a potential allergy issue with the medication.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. **Remove the incorrect relationship** between the patient and the allergen if there was a mistake in identifying the allergy to oxycodone when they have taken Epogen, assuming it is not actually an ingredient of Epogen or that the allergy information is incorrect.
2. **Verify medication ingredients**: If Epogen indeed contains oxycodone (or epogen as stated), ensure this relationship is correctly represented.

Given these considerations, here are the suggested repairs:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {ingredient_name: "Epogen"}
</repairs>
```

- The first repair removes the allergy relationship `[ra]` if it was incorrectly established.
- The second repair ensures that the ingredient name for Epogen is correctly labeled, assuming there was a mislabeling issue. If oxycodone or epogen is indeed an ingredient of Epogen, this should be verified and corrected in the graph data.
