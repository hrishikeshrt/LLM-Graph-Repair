Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, Walker122 is a patient who's taking Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. The medication has an ingredient called Walker122 with code 6847. But there's also an allergy relationship between Walker122 and the same medication with key 981.

Hmm, that seems contradictory because if someone is allergic to a medication, they shouldn't be taking it. So I need to reconcile these two facts: one as an ingredient and one as an allergy.

Looking at the graph structure, there are three relationships: rm (TAKES_MEDICATION), rc (HAS_INGREDIENT), and ra (ALLERGIC_TO). The problem is that both rc and ra exist between Walker122 and Epogen 4000. That's conflicting because you can't be an ingredient in a medication you're allergic to.

I think the solution here is to remove either the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship or the ALLERGIC_TO relationship so that only one of them exists, thus resolving the inconsistency.

So I'll suggest removing the rc (HAS_INGREDIENT) edge because if the allergy is correct, taking the medication would be inappropriate. Alternatively, maybe the ingredient information is wrong and should be removed as well.

Wait, but maybe the key 981 is more accurate than having Walker122 as an ingredient with code 6847. So perhaps removing rc makes sense to keep the allergy relationship intact.
