Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there's a patient who has a medication (node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93) with code 205923. The medication is described as "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection". This patient is allergic to this medication, but the graph also shows that the patient has an ingredient relationship (via rc:HAS_INGREDIENT) which includes the same ingredient.

Wait a minute, if the patient is taking this medication and it's listed as having an ingredient in the graph, isn't that redundant? The medication itself already contains the ingredient. So adding another HAS_INGREDIENT edge might be unnecessary or causing duplication issues.

I think the problem here is that there are two edges from the same node: one for TAKES_MEDICATION and another for HAS_INGREDIENT to the same medication node. This could lead to inconsistencies because the medication's description already includes the ingredient, so having an additional edge might not be accurate.

To fix this, I should probably remove the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship. That way, we avoid duplication and ensure that each relationship is correctly represented without redundancy.
