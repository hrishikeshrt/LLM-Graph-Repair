The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the patient being both prescribed and allergic to oxycodone. The "TAKES_MEDICATION" edge indicates that the patient has taken oxycodone, while the "ALLERGIC_TO" edge suggests an allergy to it. This is contradictory as patients are typically not prescribed medications they are allergic to.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes oxycodone. Here's how we can address this:

This operation removes the "TAKES_MEDICATION" edge between the patient and oxycodone, resolving the inconsistency by ensuring the patient is not recorded as taking a medication they are allergic to.
