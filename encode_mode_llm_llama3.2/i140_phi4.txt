The inconsistency arises from the fact that the patient is taking a medication containing an ingredient, ferrous sulfate, to which they are allergic. This poses a health risk and should be addressed.

To resolve this issue, we can suggest the following repairs:

1. **Remove the relationship** between the patient and the medication if it's not appropriate for them to take due to their allergy.
2. Alternatively, update the medication or ingredient details if there is an error in identifying ferrous sulfate as a risk.

Here are the suggested graph repair operations:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | i:Ingredient {id: "ferrous_sulfate"} | {risk_level: "low"}
</repairs> 

These repairs remove the patient's relationship with the medication and adjust the risk level of ferrous sulfate if it was incorrectly identified as a high-risk ingredient. Adjustments should be made based on accurate medical information.
