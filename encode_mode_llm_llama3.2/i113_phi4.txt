Based on the description of the inconsistency, it appears that there are two main issues:

1. The patient has an allergy to oxycodone, but this should not be represented as a direct relationship from the medication (Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) to the ingredient since Epogen does not contain oxycodone.

2. There is no explicit information about when the patient stopped taking the medication, which might need representation if it's crucial for the graph context.

Here are the suggested repairs:

This operation removes the incorrect relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to an ingredient (oxycodone) that is not part of their current medication (Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection). 

If additional context or constraints were provided, such as needing to record when a medication was discontinued, further operations could be suggested. However, based on the given description, this single operation addresses the primary inconsistency identified.
