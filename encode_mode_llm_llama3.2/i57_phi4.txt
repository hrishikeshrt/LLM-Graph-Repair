To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that specific details about the ingredient and allergy are provided. Here's how we can repair the graph:

1. **Add Ingredient Details**: Since there are no specific details about the ingredient associated with the medication, we should add a node for the ingredient with relevant properties.

2. **Link Allergy to Specific Ingredient**: The patient is allergic to some ingredients, but no specifics are provided. We need to ensure that the allergy relationship points to a specific ingredient.

Here's how these repairs can be structured:

<repairs>
ADD_NODE | (i:Ingredient) | {name: "Fluticasone", type: "Corticosteroid"}
ADD_EDGE | [rc] | -
UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {allergen: "Fluticasone"}
</repairs>

Explanation:
- **ADD_NODE**: We add an ingredient node with the name "Fluticasone" and its type, assuming it's a common ingredient in Flovent.
- **ADD_EDGE**: Ensure there is a relationship from the medication to this new ingredient.
- **UPD_EDGE**: Update the allergy edge to specify that the patient is allergic to Fluticasone.
