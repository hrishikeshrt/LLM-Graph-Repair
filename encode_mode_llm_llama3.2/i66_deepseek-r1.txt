Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me read through the problem again.

The graph has a patient who took medication 205923, which is epoetin alfa, and it's marked as an ingredient with label [Ingredient]. But there's also an allergy to epoetin alfa from 1975. The note says that the allergy info isn't an error.

Hmm, so if the patient was allergic to epoetin alfa but took it until 1975, maybe the allergy period should match when they were taking the medication. That makes sense because you can't be allergic while on the medication; you'd have reacted by now.

So, I think we need to adjust the allergy relationship so that it ends in 1975 instead of later. That way, there's no inconsistency between allergy and medication use.

To do this, I'll remove the existing allergy edge (rm) and add a new one ending at 1975-06-18T09:30:42Z. This ensures that the allergy period aligns with when they were taking epoetin alfa.
