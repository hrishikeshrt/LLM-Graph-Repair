Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's medical information. The patient is identified as [3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d], who was born on June 22, 1923, and lives at [935 Rempel Trail]. 

This patient has been prescribed the medication Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which is labeled as a medication with code [205923]. The patient takes this medication under the supervision of their doctor.

The patient also has an allergy to oxycodone, a different medication. This relationship is established by the "ALLERGIC_TO" edge between the patient's node and the oxycodone node.

Furthermore, there is a connection between the patient's node and the oxycodone node through the "TAKES_MEDICATION" edge, which indicates that the patient has taken this medication at some point. The start date of taking this medication is July 2, 2015.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
