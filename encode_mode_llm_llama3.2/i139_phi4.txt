The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises because a patient who is allergic to naproxen should not be taking a medication that contains naproxen as an ingredient. The current graph indicates that the patient takes verapamil hydrochloride, which is incorrectly linked to an ingredient node representing naproxen.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to ensure that there is no relationship between the patient and any medication containing naproxen if they are allergic to it. Since the issue lies with the connection between the medication (verapamil hydrochloride) and the ingredient (naproxen), we should remove the incorrect edge linking them.

Here's the suggested repair:

This operation removes the relationship `[HAS_INGREDIENT]` between verapamil hydrochloride and naproxen, ensuring that the patient is not taking a medication containing an allergen they are allergic to.
