   UPD_NODE | [i:Ingredient] | {name: "Olmesartan medoxomil"}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the `Ingredient` node to reflect its correct name, which is "Olmesartan medoxomil". The reason for this repair is that the current representation shows "Olmesartan" as an ingredient, but it seems more accurate to represent the full name of the medication's active ingredient.
