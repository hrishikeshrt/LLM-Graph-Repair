Based on the description provided, there are two main inconsistencies:

1. The patient has an allergy to an unknown substance, yet it's linked through a medication ingredient that should be known.
2. Medication with ID [51991] is associated with an ingredient, but no specific ingredient details are given.

To address these issues, we can perform the following repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | i:Ingredient {id: 987} | name: "Unknown Allergen"
</repairs>

<repairs>
ADD_EDGE | (m:Medication {id: 51991})-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient {id: 987}) | -
</repairs> 

These operations ensure that the ingredient for which the patient is allergic is explicitly identified as "Unknown Allergen" and correctly linked to the medication record.
