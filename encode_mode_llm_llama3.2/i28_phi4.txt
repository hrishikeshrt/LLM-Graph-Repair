The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves a patient being allergic to an ingredient found in a medication they are taking. This situation should not occur, as it poses a significant health risk.

To resolve this issue, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to the ingredient oxycodone found in Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. Additionally, since the patient should not be taking a medication they are allergic to, we also need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this medication.
