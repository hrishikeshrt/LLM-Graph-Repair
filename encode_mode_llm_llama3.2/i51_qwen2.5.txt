This repair operation suggests updating the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship to include a specific date, which is factually accurate as it indicates when the patient became allergic to warfarin. However, since no exact date was provided in the original description, this is an educated guess based on typical medical records practices where allergies are noted upon diagnosis or first encounter with the medication.
