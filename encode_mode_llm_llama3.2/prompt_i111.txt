        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)

        The graph represents a patient's medical information. The patient is identified by the ID [3f336702-bf73-4fc8-bd59-3ba77fd65d0d], and their birthdate is June 22, 1923. The patient lives at [935 Rempel Trail]. 

The patient is prescribed medication with the code [205923] for a specific medical condition, which is Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. This medication has an expiration date of not specified.

The patient's name is Sanford861 and their last name is Fritsch593. The medication has been taken by the patient since April 18, 2019, with no errors reported. 

There is a relationship between the patient and the medication where the patient takes the medication (TAKES_MEDICATION) and there is also an indication of allergy to the medication (ALLERGIC_TO), however, this does not seem to be the case as there are no reported allergic reactions.

The medication has an ingredient label that states it contains oxycodone.
