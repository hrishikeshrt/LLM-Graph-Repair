The inconsistency arises because an Ingredient node, labeled with ID `ferrous sulfate`, incorrectly has properties of a Medication. Specifically, it has a Medication code and description that should belong to a Medication node instead.

To resolve this issue:

1. Create a new Medication node with the correct properties.
2. Relink the existing relationships from the Ingredient node to the newly created Medication node.

Here are the suggested repairs:

ADD_NODE | (m:Medication) | {code: 860975, description: "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet"}
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
ADD_EDGE | (i)-[:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(m) | -
