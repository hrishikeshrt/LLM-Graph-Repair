The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises from the fact that a patient who has passed away on March 19, 1977, is recorded as taking epoetin alfa starting from May 4, 1975. This suggests an error since the medication regimen should not extend beyond the patient's date of death.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to adjust the start date of the medication relationship so that it does not conflict with the patient's date of death.

This repair operation updates the `TAKES_MEDICATION` edge to ensure the start date is before or on the date of the patient's death, maintaining factual accuracy.
