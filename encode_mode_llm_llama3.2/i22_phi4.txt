To address the inconsistency described, we need to ensure that there are no contradictory relationships involving the patient's allergy status and medication intake. The inconsistency arises from a lack of an allergic reaction record for the patient concerning "oxycodone," which is also identified as an ingredient they are allergic to.

Here's how we can resolve this:

1. **Remove the incorrect allergy relationship**: Since there is no record of the patient being allergic to "oxycodone" (the medication), but there is a relationship indicating an allergy to its ingredient, we should remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient.
