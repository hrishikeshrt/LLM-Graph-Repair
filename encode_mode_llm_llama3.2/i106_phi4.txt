Based on the provided description, the inconsistency lies in the patient's allergy to epinephrine while taking Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. The graph does not indicate that epinephrine is an ingredient of Epogen, so there should be no direct relationship between the patient and epinephrine through their medication.

To resolve this:

1. Remove the incorrect allergic reaction link to epinephrine if it is not justified by the ingredients of Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection.
