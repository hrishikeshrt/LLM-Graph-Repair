Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:
---

        MATCH (p:Patient)-[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(m:Medication)-[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i:Ingredient),
            (p)-[ra:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i)
        RETURN *
        The graph represents a patient's information. The patient is identified by the ID [2c71dd97-7085-416a-aa07-d675bbe3adf2]. The patient has an address at [531 Collier Wynd] and was born on February 14, 1941. 

A medication, specifically warfarin, with code [855332], is prescribed to the patient. Warfarin is a medication for treating blood clotting disorders.

The patient is allergic to warfarin, as indicated by an edge labeled [ALLERGIC_TO] connecting the patient node to the warfarin node. 

Additionally, the patient takes warfarin according to an edge labeled [TAKES_MEDICATION], which connects the patient node to the warfarin node.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
