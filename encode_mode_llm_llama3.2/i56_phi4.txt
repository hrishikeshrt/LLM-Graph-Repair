The inconsistency arises because the patient is both taking a medication that contains ferrous sulfate and being allergic to it. This suggests an error in labeling or relationship assignment, as typically a person would not be prescribed a medication they are allergic to.

To resolve this, we should remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing ferrous sulfate, assuming the allergy information is correct and prioritized for safety.
