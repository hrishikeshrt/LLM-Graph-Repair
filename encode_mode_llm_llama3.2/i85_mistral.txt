   </repairs>

This repair operation will update the ingredient node to have an empty code and description, and add a new relationship between the patient and the ingredient with the label "IS_NOT_ALLERGIC_TO" and property 'when' set to the last seen date of the patient. This change reflects that the patient is no longer allergic to the ingredient.
