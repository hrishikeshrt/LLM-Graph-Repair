The inconsistency arises because a single node has conflicting labels and identifiers for both a `Patient` and an `Ingredient`. To resolve this, we need to separate these entities into distinct nodes with the correct properties.

1. Create a new `Ingredient` node with the identifier `[mestranol]`.
2. Update the existing node to be solely a `Patient` with its own unique identifier.
3. Re-establish relationships using the newly created `Ingredient` node.
