The inconsistency arises because a single node is labeled both as an `Ingredient` and a `Patient`, which should not be possible. The node with ID `4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93` is incorrectly labeled as both, leading to conflicting information about the patient's allergy and medication.

To resolve this, we need to separate these entities into distinct nodes:

1. Remove the `Patient` label from the node currently mislabeled.
2. Create a new `Patient` node with the correct properties.
3. Establish the appropriate relationships between the newly created `Patient` node and the existing `Medication` and `Ingredient` nodes.

Here are the suggested repairs:
