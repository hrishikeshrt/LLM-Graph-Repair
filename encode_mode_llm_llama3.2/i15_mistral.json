However, the patient has an allergy to oxycodone that is not represented in the graph. To fix this inconsistency, we need to add a new Allergy node for the patient and update the Oxycodone ingredient with its correct ID. Additionally, since the patient's information does not explicitly state that they are allergic to oxycodone, we also update the patient node to include this allergy information.",
