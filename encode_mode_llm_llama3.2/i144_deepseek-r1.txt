Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix the inconsistency described. 

First, I see that there are two medications mentioned for the patient. The first part of the code says the patient takes a medication with code 999967 until February 26, 2016, and was prescribed on November 27, 2015. But then it mentions another medication with code [Tribenzor], which includes Amlodipine, HCTZ, and Olmesartan. 

Wait, that's confusing because the first part seems to be about a single medication (999967) but then there are three ingredients listed for another medication called Tribenzor. So maybe the issue is that the patient has two different medications: one with code 999967 and another with multiple ingredients.

Looking at the graph structure, the query matches Patient to Medication (rm), which has an ID of 999967, then to Ingredient via HAS_INGREDIENT. But there's also a direct match from Patient to Ingredient via ALLERGIC_TO. 

So perhaps the problem is that the patient is being linked twice: once through the medication with code 999967 and another time through the allergy to an ingredient in Tribenzor. This might cause inconsistencies because the patient can't be both taking a medication and having an allergy unless they are different medications.

Therefore, I think we need to separate these two relationships. We should remove the edge that connects the Patient directly to the Ingredient via ALLERGIC_TO if it's not related to the same medication as 999967. Alternatively, maybe the allergy information is correct and should remain, but the medication with code 999967 shouldn't be linked through HAS_INGREDIENT.

So, perhaps we need to remove the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship for the first medication (code 999967) so that the allergy is only related to the Tribenzor ingredients. That way, the graph accurately reflects separate medications and their respective relationships.
