This repair suggests updating the node "oxycodone" to "hydrocodone", removing the allergy relationship between the patient and oxycodone, and adding a new allergy relationship between the patient and hydrocodone. The changes ensure that the graph remains factually accurate while minimizing the number of operations needed.
