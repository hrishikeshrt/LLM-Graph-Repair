Explanation: The inconsistency is that the ingredient 'oxycodone' is listed as an ingredient of the medication '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', which is incorrect. To fix this, we can update the allergen node (Ingredient node) to have a code of 'not-applicable' since it doesn't have a specific code for an ingredient. Then, we remove the relationship between the Medication and Ingredient nodes as it is factually incorrect.
