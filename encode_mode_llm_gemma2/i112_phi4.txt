Explanation for the output:
- The patient is allergic to oxycodone, which is an ingredient of Epogen. Since the patient takes Epogen and is allergic to one of its ingredients, there's a risk involved.
- To resolve this inconsistency, the safest approach is to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes Epogen (`[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]`), as it poses a health risk due to the allergy.
