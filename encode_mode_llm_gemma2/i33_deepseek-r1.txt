Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, there are two relationships involving Oxycodone and Epogen that seem conflicting.

First, the patient (cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1) is allergic to Oxycodone. But then, they're taking Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which also has Oxycodone as an ingredient. That doesn't make sense because if the patient is allergic to Oxycodone, they shouldn't be taking something that contains it.

Looking at the graph query, there are two relationships: [ra] from Patient to Ingredient and [rm] from Patient to Medication, which connects to another relationship [rc] to the ingredient. So, the problem is that both [ra] and [rc] point to Oxycodone in the same way.

I think we need to remove one of these relationships to fix the inconsistency. Maybe the allergy should take precedence over the ingredient presence because if someone is allergic to an ingredient, they shouldn't be taking a medication with it regardless.

So, perhaps deleting the [ra] relationship would make sense. That way, the allergy remains, but the medication's ingredient issue is resolved.
