   <repairExplanation>
      The given graph indicates that oxycodone is an ingredient of 1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which is incorrect. To fix this inconsistency, we update the node representing oxycodone to have a correct name (Hydrocodone) and remove the relationship between oxycodone and the medication.
