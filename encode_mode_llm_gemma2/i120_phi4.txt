The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern indicates that a patient, who is allergic to oxycodone, is taking Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which contains oxycodone as an ingredient. This situation poses a potential health risk due to the allergy.

To resolve this issue factually and safely, we should prevent the patient from taking any medication containing an allergen they are allergic to. The most direct approach is to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, as it contains oxycodone, to which the patient is allergic.
