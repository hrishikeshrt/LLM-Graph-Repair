Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are four nodes: a patient (Walker122), a medication called '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection' with code 205923, an ingredient (6847), and another instance of the same medication (6846). The relationships between them include taking the medication, having an ingredient, and being allergic.

Wait a minute. There are two nodes for the same medication: one is labeled as 'Medication' with code 205923, and another is just 'Medication'. That seems redundant. Also, both have different detailsâ€”6846 has the name and code, while 6847 is just an ingredient.

So, I think the issue here is that there are two separate nodes representing what should be one medication node. This duplication can cause inconsistencies in relationships because the patient is taking multiple medications if they're both separate nodes, but according to the data, it's just one medication with different attributes.

To fix this, I should probably remove the duplicate 'Medication' node (6846) and update the existing one (205923) to include all necessary details. That way, there's only one node for that medication, and everything related is correctly linked without duplication.

So the steps would be:
1. Delete the node with ID 6846 since it's redundant.
2. Update the node with code 205923 to add the name property.

This should resolve the inconsistency by ensuring there's only one medication node and all its details are correctly set.
