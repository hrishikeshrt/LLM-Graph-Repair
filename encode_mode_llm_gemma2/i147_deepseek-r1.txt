Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there's a patient who is taking three medications: Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG / Olmesartan medoxomil 20 MG Oral Tablet [Tribenzor]. The problem seems to be that one of these medications has an incorrect allergy relationship.

Looking at the graph query, I see two relationships: rm (TAKES_MEDICATION) and ra (ALLERGIC_TO). The patient is linked via rm to each medication. Then, each medication is connected via rc (HAS_INGREDIENT) to the ingredient olmesartan.

The issue here is that the ALLERGIC_TO relationship might not be correctly set for one of the medications. Specifically, Olmesartan should have an ALLERGIC_TO relationship with the patient since it's a known allergy. However, Amlodipine and HCTZ don't necessarily have this allergy.

So, I need to adjust the graph so that only Olmesartan has the ra (ALLERGIC_TO) relationship with the patient. That means I should remove the ALLERGIC_TO relationships from Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG and keep Olmesartan as it is.

In terms of graph operations, this would involve deleting the edges for the ra relationships where the medication isn't supposed to have an allergy. So I'll need to perform two DEL_EDGE operations: one for Amlodipine and another for HCTZ.

I should make sure that each edge operation specifies the correct relationship variable (ra) and targets the specific nodes involved.
