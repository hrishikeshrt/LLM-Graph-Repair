Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, we have a patient who is taking three medications: Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG / Olmesartan medoxomil 20 MG Oral Tablet [Tribenzor]. The patient is also allergic to Olmesartan. Now, looking at the graph structure:

The patient (p) is connected via rm to a medication (m), which has an ingredient (i). Then, the patient is connected via ra to the same ingredient i.

But wait, according to the data, the patient takes three medications, but in the graph, it's only showing one medication with multiple ingredients. That seems like a problem because each medication should be its own node with its own ingredients.

So, first issue: The medication node (m) is being created once even though there are three different medications. So we need to split that into separate nodes for each medication.

Next, looking at the relationships, the patient has an rm relationship pointing to one m node that includes all three drugs as ingredients. But in reality, each drug should have its own rm and rc relationships because they might have different ingredients.

Also, the ra relationship is only connecting the patient directly to olmesartan, but according to the data, the patient is allergic to all three medications: Amlodipine, HCTZ, and Olmesartan. So the ra edge should be pointing to each of these individual ingredients instead of just one.

So to fix this:

1. Split the medication node into separate nodes for each drug (Amlodipine, HCTZ, Olmesartan). Each will have its own rm relationship with the patient and rc relationships listing their respective ingredients.

2. Update the ra edge from [olmesartan] to include all three drugs: Amlodipine, HCTZ, and Olmesartan.

3. Remove the original rm relationship that connects the single medication node to the patient since each drug now has its own rm.

4. Add the missing rm relationships for each new medication node pointing back to the patient.

5. Update the rc relationships on each medication node to list their specific ingredients (like Amlodipine 5 MG, etc.).

6. Ensure that the ra edges point to all three individual ingredients instead of just olmesartan.
