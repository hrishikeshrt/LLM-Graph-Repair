In this case, the patient is allergic to the ingredient (oxycodone) but also takes the medication containing that same ingredient. To fix the inconsistency, we update the patient node's allergy property to null and delete the existing allergy relationship. This represents the possibility that the patient may no longer be allergic to oxycodone or the information is incorrect.
