The inconsistency in this graph pattern arises from a patient being allergic to an ingredient that is part of a medication they are taking. This situation suggests either a data entry error or a misunderstanding of the relationships between nodes.

To address this, we need to determine whether the allergy information is incorrect or if there's another explanation for why the patient is both taking the medication and allergic to its ingredient. Since the `is_error` property on the `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge is set to '1', it indicates a potential error in associating the ingredient with the medication.

Here are the suggested repairs:

1. **Remove the erroneous relationship between the Medication and Ingredient** if the association itself is incorrect.
2. **Remove the Allergic_To relationship** if the patient's allergy information is found to be inaccurate or irrelevant due to other considerations (e.g., alternative formulations of the medication that do not contain the allergen).

Given the provided data, we will proceed with removing the erroneous `HAS_INGREDIENT` edge:

If further investigation confirms that the allergy information is also incorrect, then you would additionally remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship:
