   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the allergen property of the Ingredient node (target i) to include "oxycodone". It also removes the allergy relationship between the Patient and the Ingredient nodes (target ra). This repair assumes that the patient is allergic to a combination of ingredients, not just oxycodone. If the patient is only allergic to oxycodone, then the suggested repairs would be different.
