Explanation: The inconsistency suggests that oxycodone is an ingredient of Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which is incorrect. Therefore, we need to remove the existing relationship between oxycodone and the medication and add a correct one involving a different ingredient ID (assuming there's another ingredient for this medication).
