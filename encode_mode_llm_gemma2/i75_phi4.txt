The inconsistency arises because a patient, Walker122, who is allergic to an ingredient (epoetin alfa) in a medication they are taking ('1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'), should not be prescribed that medication due to the allergy. This situation poses a risk and needs correction.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the relationship indicating that Walker122 takes '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection', as it contains an ingredient to which they are allergic.
2. Optionally, ensure that any other necessary updates or notes regarding the allergy and medication are addressed in patient records or alerts.
