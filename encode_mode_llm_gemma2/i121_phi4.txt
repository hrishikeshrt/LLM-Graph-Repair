The inconsistency in the graph is that a patient (`Sanford861`) who is allergic to `oxycodone` is also taking a medication (`Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection`) that contains `oxycodone`. This situation poses a potential health risk and should be addressed.

This operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient and the medication, thus preventing the patient from being associated with a medication that contains an allergen.
