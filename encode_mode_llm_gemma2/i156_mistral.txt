These repairs address the inconsistency by replacing ferrous sulfate with another iron-containing ingredient (e.g., ferrous gluconate), removing the incorrect relationship between the medication and ferrous sulfate as an ingredient, updating the patient's allergy information, renaming the medication to reflect the change in its ingredients, and adjusting the duration of the medication intake for the patient.
