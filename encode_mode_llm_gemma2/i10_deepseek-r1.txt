Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

From the description, there are two nodes: one with code 6757 and another with 6846. Both have an "oxycodone" as their ingredient. That seems off because oxycodone shouldn't be found in both places unless it's a mistake.

Looking at the relationships, Node 6203 (Brekke496) is allergic to 6757 and takes 6846. But since 6757 is an ingredient of 6846, having them both as ingredients might be redundant or incorrect if they're different substances.

I think the issue here is that Node 6757 shouldn't have "oxycodone" listed twice. So maybe we need to remove one occurrence of it from either node. But since both nodes are showing it, perhaps we should just delete "oxycodone" from one of them to fix the inconsistency.

So, I'll choose to delete "oxycodone" from Node 6757 because that's where it appears twice. This way, each node will have unique ingredients without duplication.
