The inconsistency identified here involves a patient being allergic to an ingredient that they are taking as part of their medication. Specifically, the patient is allergic to "olmesartan," but they are taking a medication (Tribenzor) that contains this ingredient.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the graph accurately reflects the allergy information. Since the patient should not be taking a medication containing an allergen, one approach could be to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the specific medication containing "olmesartan."

Here are the suggested repairs:

This operation removes the relationship between the patient and the medication "Tribenzor" since it contains an ingredient ("olmesartan") to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that the graph no longer indicates the patient takes a medication containing their allergen.
