The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises because a patient who is allergic to an ingredient should not be taking a medication that contains that ingredient. In this case, the patient is allergic to ferrous sulfate and is taking 24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet, which contains ferrous sulfate as an ingredient.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen.
