This is because the current edge has an `is_error` value of '1', which suggests that there might be an error in this relationship. However, since the medication is indeed an ingredient of something, we correct the error by updating it.\n\nThe second repair operation deletes the edge between Node [6757] (Ingredient) and Node [m:Medication]. This edge is present because the Ingredient node is also connected to a Medication node via the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship, which seems incorrect. Since an ingredient cannot be both an ingredient of itself and a medication at the same time, we remove this connection.",
