In this example, the inconsistency is that oxycodone (ingredient i) is listed as an ingredient of Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection (m), but the patient is allergic to oxycodone. To fix this, we update the ingredient node's properties so it no longer represents oxycodone, and remove the allergy relationship between the patient and oxycodone. This repair assumes that Epogen does not contain oxycodone as an ingredient.
