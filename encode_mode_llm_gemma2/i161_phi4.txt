The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that a patient named "Fritsch593" and "Isiah14" is allergic to ferrous sulfate, which is an ingredient of the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet". Additionally, this patient takes the same medication. This situation presents a potential health risk due to the allergy.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to ensure that the patient does not take the medication containing the allergen. The repair operation involves removing the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication.
