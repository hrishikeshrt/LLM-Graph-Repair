The inconsistency arises because a patient who takes Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, which contains oxycodone as an ingredient, is also allergic to oxycodone. This suggests that either the medication or allergy information might be incorrect.

To resolve this, we can consider two potential repairs:

1. **Remove the Allergy Relationship**: If the patient's allergy to oxycodone is incorrectly recorded and they are not actually allergic, we should remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and oxycodone.

2. **Remove the Ingredient Relationship**: If it is incorrect that Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection contains oxycodone as an ingredient, we should remove the `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection and oxycodone.

Given these options, here are two possible repair suggestions:

**Option 1: Remove Allergy Relationship**
