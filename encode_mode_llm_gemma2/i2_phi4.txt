The inconsistency in this scenario is that a patient is taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic. To resolve this, we need to ensure that the patient does not take medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.

Here's how we can address it:

1. **Remove the relationship** between the patient and the medication since the patient should not be taking a medication containing an allergen.

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -

```

This operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship, ensuring that the patient is no longer associated with taking HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet. This change addresses the inconsistency by preventing the patient from consuming a medication containing an allergen.
