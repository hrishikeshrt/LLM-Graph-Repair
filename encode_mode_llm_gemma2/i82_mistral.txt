    </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the ingredient node to include both its name (epoetin alfa) and a new property indicating that it is an allergen. Additionally, it removes the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient since the ingredient is now considered an allergen for this patient.
