The inconsistency arises because the patient is taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic. The following repair operations can be considered:

1. If it's confirmed that the patient should not take this medication due to their allergy, remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication.

2. Alternatively, if the allergy information is incorrect and the patient is not actually allergic to Oxycodone, remove the relationship indicating the allergy.

Here are the suggested repairs based on these considerations:
