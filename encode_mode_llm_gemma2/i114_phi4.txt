The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern indicates that a patient who is allergic to oxycodone is taking Epogen, which contains oxycodone as an ingredient. This situation poses a potential health risk due to the allergy.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the patient does not take any medication containing ingredients they are allergic to. Here are the suggested repairs:

1. Remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes Epogen.
2. Alternatively, if it is confirmed that the patient should indeed be taking Epogen despite the allergy (e.g., due to a medical exception), ensure that the allergy information is correct or updated.

Assuming no exceptions and prioritizing safety by preventing the patient from taking Epogen:
