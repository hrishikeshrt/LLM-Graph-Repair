This repair suggests that the patient's allergy to epoetin alfa is removed, the relationship between the patient and the Epogen injection is deleted, and the patient-medication relationship is updated to remove the allergy property. This repair assumes that the patient should not be taking the Epogen injection due to their allergy, but it does not address the incorrect ingredient information for the Epogen injection itself. To correct this issue, further investigation and updates would be required on the Medication-Ingredient relationships.
