   </repairs>

   This repair suggests updating the `Patient` node to remove its allergy to oxycodone, and deleting the existing relationship between the patient and oxycodone. The updated allergies property for the patient node will contain a key-value pair that sets oxycodone's value to false, indicating that the patient is no longer allergic to it.
