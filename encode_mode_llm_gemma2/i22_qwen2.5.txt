Explanation:
- The ingredient `oxycodone` is incorrectly linked to the medication `1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection`. We need to remove this incorrect relationship and add a correct one where `oxycodone` is actually an ingredient in some other medication.
- Since the exact correct medication is not specified, we assume there's another medication that contains oxycodone. For simplicity, let's say it should be linked to a different medication with ID 6758 (this would need to be verified and replaced with actual data).
