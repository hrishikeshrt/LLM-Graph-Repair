The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that a patient who is allergic to an ingredient should not be taking a medication containing that same ingredient. In this case, the patient is allergic to "mestranol" and is also taking "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which contains "mestranol."

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen.
