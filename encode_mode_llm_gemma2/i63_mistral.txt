   UPD_NODE | [p] | {allergies: {ferrous_sulfate: false}}
   </repairs>

   This repair suggests updating the 'Patient' node with a property change to indicate that the patient is no longer allergic to ferrous sulfate. The key-value pair for the property 'allergies' contains the ingredient as a key and a boolean value indicating whether or not the patient is allergic. In this case, the value is set to false since the patient should not be allergic to ferrous sulfate after the repair.
