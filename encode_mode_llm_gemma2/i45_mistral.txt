The patient is allergic to the medication, but the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship should be removed since the patient cannot take something they are allergic to. Additionally, the patient's tau_o property should be updated to 1 (indicating that the patient is currently alive) as the deathdate provided is earlier than the birthdate.
