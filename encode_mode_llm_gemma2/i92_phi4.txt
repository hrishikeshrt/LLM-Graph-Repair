The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that the patient is allergic to "mestranol," which is listed as an ingredient of "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension." However, if a patient takes this medication and is allergic to one of its ingredients, it could pose a health risk. The logical correction would be to remove the relationship indicating that the patient is taking the medication containing the allergen.
