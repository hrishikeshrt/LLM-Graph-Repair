The inconsistency arises because a patient who takes a medication containing an allergen should not be taking that medication. The patient `cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1` is allergic to oxycodone, which is an ingredient of the medication they are taking (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection). Therefore, the relationship indicating that the patient takes this medication should be removed.
