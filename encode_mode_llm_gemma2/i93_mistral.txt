This repair suggests that the patient's allergy list should be updated to exclude mestranol, the medication taken by the patient should be removed (as it is causing an inconsistency), and a new relationship TAKES_MEDICATION should be added between the patient and a different medication. The medication node's prescription property is also filtered to exclude Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension.
