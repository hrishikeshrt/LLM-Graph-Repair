The inconsistency lies in the fact that a patient who takes a medication containing an ingredient to which they are allergic should not be taking that medication. The graph indicates that Patient [5840] is both "TAKES_MEDICATION" and "ALLERGIC_TO" the same Ingredient [6757].

To address this, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen.
