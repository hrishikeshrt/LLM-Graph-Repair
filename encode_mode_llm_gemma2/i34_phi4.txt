The inconsistency arises because a patient who is allergic to an ingredient (`oxycodone`) is taking medication that contains this ingredient. The graph should reflect accurate medical records, ensuring patients are not prescribed medications they are allergic to.

To resolve the inconsistency:

1. **Remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen.**

This operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient and the Epogen injection, which contains oxycodone, to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that the graph accurately reflects safe medical practices.

If there are additional constraints or requirements (e.g., prescribing an alternative medication), further operations would be needed based on those specifics. However, with the given information, removing the problematic relationship addresses the inconsistency.
