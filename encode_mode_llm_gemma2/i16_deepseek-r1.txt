Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are two relationships involving the node 6203 (cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1). It has an "ALLERGIC_TO" relationship pointing to node 6757 (oxycodone) and an "HAS_INGREDIENT" relationship pointing to node 6846 (Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection). The problem is that the same node 6203 is both allergic to oxycodone and has taken the same medication. That doesn't make sense because if someone took a medication, they wouldn't be allergic to it.

So, looking at the relationships:
1. [ra] connects 6203 to 6757 (allergic).
2. [rc] connects 6203 to 6846 (ingredient).

The inconsistency is that both these edges should not exist together because taking a medication shouldn't make you allergic.

Now, I need to decide which edge to remove. If we keep the "HAS_INGREDIENT" relationship, then the "ALLERGIC_TO" should be removed because it's impossible for someone who took Epogen to be allergic to it. Alternatively, if we want to keep the allergy information, maybe there's another way, but in this case, since both are about the same medication, removing one makes more sense.

So, I'll choose to delete the "ALLERGIC_TO" edge because it's inconsistent with taking that medication.
