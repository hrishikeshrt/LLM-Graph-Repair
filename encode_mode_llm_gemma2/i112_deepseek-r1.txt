Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The description says that a patient is allergic to oxycodone and also takes it as an ingredient of Epogen. That doesn't make sense because if someone is allergic to something, they shouldn't take it as an ingredient. So there's a conflict here between the allergy relationship and the ingredient relationship.

Looking at the graph structure, I see that the patient (node 5840) has two relationships with oxycodone: one as 'ALLERGIC_TO' and another as 'HAS_INGREDIENT'. This duplication is causing the inconsistency. 

I think the solution would be to remove either the allergy relationship or the ingredient relationship so that only one of them exists, eliminating the conflict.

So I can choose to delete the 'HAS_INGREDIENT' edge because if someone is allergic, they shouldn't take it as an ingredient. Alternatively, deleting the 'ALLERGIC_TO' makes sense too, but since the patient actually has an allergy, maybe keeping that relationship is better and removing the incorrect one.

I'll go with deleting the 'rc:HAS_INGREDIENT' edge because that's where the inconsistency lies.
