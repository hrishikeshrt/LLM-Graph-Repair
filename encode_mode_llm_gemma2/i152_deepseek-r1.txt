Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, there are two medications mentioned here: 24 HR Glucophage and Cremin516. The problem seems to be with the relationships between these medications.

First, looking at the first part of the description, it says that metformin is an ingredient in 24 HR Glucophage. But wait, I know that metformin isn't actually a component of the Glucophage medication. So that's probably incorrect. That means we need to remove the 'metformin' as an ingredient from 24 HR Glucophage.

Then, there's Cremin516 which is allergic to metformin. But since metformin isn't in 24 HR Glucophage, this allergy doesn't apply here either. So maybe we should also remove the 'metformin' allergy from Cremin516 because it's not a valid ingredient.

Also, looking at the timeline, Cremin516 took 24 HR Glucophage from June 18 to July 16, 1994. But if metformin isn't in that medication, this information might be misleading or incorrect as well. So perhaps we should remove that relationship altogether.

So putting it all together, I think the steps are:
1. Remove 'metformin' from being an ingredient of 24 HR Glucophage.
2. Remove the allergy from Cremin516 regarding metformin since it's not a valid ingredient.
3. Remove the relationship between Cremin516 and 24 HR Glucophage because the medication doesn't contain metformin.

That should fix all the inconsistencies mentioned in the problem.
