The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern involves a patient being allergic to an ingredient that is present in a medication they are taking. This situation could pose a health risk, and thus it needs correction.

To resolve this issue, we have two primary options:
1. Remove the relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to the ingredient.
2. Remove the relationship indicating that the medication contains the allergen ingredient.

Given the context, removing the allergy information seems less appropriate unless there's evidence of a data entry error regarding the allergy itself. Therefore, the most prudent action would be to remove the relationship between the medication and the ingredient if it is indeed an incorrect association.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
```

This operation removes the `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship from the medication to the allergen, resolving the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient is not taking a medication containing an ingredient they're allergic to.
