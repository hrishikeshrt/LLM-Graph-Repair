In this case, the patient is allergic to the ingredient but also takes the medication that contains it. To resolve the inconsistency, we update the allergen property of the Ingredient node to remove the patient's ID from the list of allergens and delete the `ra` edge connecting the patient and the ingredient. This ensures that the patient is no longer marked as allergic to the ingredient in question.
