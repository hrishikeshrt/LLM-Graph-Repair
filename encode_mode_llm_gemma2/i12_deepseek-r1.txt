Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

From the description, there are three nodes: 6757 (oxycodone), 6846 (1 ML Epogen injection), and 6203 (cae10920...). The relationships between them are a bit confusing. 

First, Node 6757 is connected to Node 6846 via rm:TAKES_MEDICATION. That means the patient takes this medication. Then, both 6757 and another node (which I think is also 6203) have an HAS_INGREDIENT relationship with 6846. Wait, that can't be right because a medication shouldn't have two ingredients at the same time unless it's a mixture.

Also, Node 6203 is allergic to Oxycodone (Node 6757). So, there's an ALLERGIC_TO relationship between them.

But here's the issue: if Node 6203 is allergic to Oxycodone and also takes the same medication, that doesn't make sense. Allergies shouldn't apply to the same drug taken by a patient.

So, looking at the graph, there are two edges from Node 6203 to both Node 6757 (allergic) and Node 6846 (ingredient). But since 6846 is an injection containing Oxycodone, it's not an independent ingredient but part of a mixture. Therefore, the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship shouldn't be there because the medication as a whole contains multiple ingredients.

So, I think we should remove the HAS_INGREDIENT edge from Node 6203 to Node 6846. That way, the allergy is correctly associated with Oxycodone without conflicting with its presence in the injection.
