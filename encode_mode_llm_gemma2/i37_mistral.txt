   The first repair suggests that the ingredient of Plavix should be updated to match the description. It also adds a relationship between Plavix and the medication node, indicating that Plavix is contained within the medication.

   The second repair removes the existing allergy edge between the patient and the ingredient (Plavix), as it contradicts the new medication intake information. Then it adds a new allergy edge between the patient and the medication (Plavix), indicating that the patient is allergic to Plavix starting from January 27, 2017 and ongoing.
