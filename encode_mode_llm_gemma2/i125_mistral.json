To fix this inconsistency, we update the node for the allergen to indicate it's not an allergen (UPD_NODE), update the relationship between the patient and the allergen to stop at the same time as when it started (UPD_EDGE), and update the relationship between the patient and the medication to start after the current timestamp and continue indefinitely (ongoing) (UPD_EDGE).",
