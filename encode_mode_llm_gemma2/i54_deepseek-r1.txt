Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the details given.

First, there's a patient node connected to a medication via TAKES_MEDICATION. The medication is Coumadin 5 MG Oral Tablet with code 855332. Then, the patient is also linked to an ingredient called warfarin through ALLERGIC_TO. That doesn't make sense because Coumadin shouldn't be allergic to warfarin.

I think the problem here is that the medication and the ingredient are connected incorrectly. The 'warfarin' should not be a separate node if it's part of the medication. Maybe I need to remove the 'warfarin' as an ingredient since it doesn't belong there.

So, the edge from medication (855332) to warfarin is wrong. I'll delete that edge using DEL_EDGE with key 977 and type_ HAS_INGREDIENT.
