Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The query shows a patient taking a medication and an ingredient. Specifically, it mentions that Humulin 70/30 is both a medication and an ingredient. That doesn't make sense because Humulin should be a medication, not an ingredient in another medication. 

Looking at the nodes: there's a patient (6408) who takes (6786), which is Humulin. Then, 6786 has an ingredient relationship with 6776, mestranol. Also, the patient is allergic to 6776.

So, the main issue here is that 6786 should be a medication, not an ingredient. That means we need to correct its type property from 'ingredient' to 'medication'. 

I don't see any other inconsistencies because all relationships seem logical once 6786's type is fixed.
