Based on the provided description of an inconsistency, I suggest the following graph repairs:

<repairs>
ADD_NODE | [i] | {name: "oxycodone", type: "medication"}
ADD_EDGE | [rc] | {from: [m], to: [i]}
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_NODE | [p] | {allergies: ["oxycodone"]}
UPD_NODE | [i] | {name: "epogen 4000 unt/ml injection"}
ADD_EDGE | [ra] | {from: [p], to: [i]}
</repairs>

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
ADD_EDGE | [rc] | {from: [m], to: [i]}
UPD_NODE | [m] | {ingredients: ["oxycodone"]}
</repairs>
