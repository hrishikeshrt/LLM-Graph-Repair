The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that a patient who is allergic to an ingredient (`mestranol`) is also taking a medication (`Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension`) that contains this allergen. To resolve this factual inconsistency, we need to address the relationship between the patient and the medication.

Suggested repairs:

1. Remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to.
