The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that a patient who is allergic to an ingredient should not be taking medication containing that ingredient. In this case, the patient is allergic to "mestranol" and is also taking "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension," which contains "mestranol." To resolve this inconsistency, we need to address the relationship between the patient and the medication.

The appropriate repair operation is to remove the edge representing the patient taking the medication. This ensures that the graph accurately reflects the fact that a patient should not be prescribed medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to.
