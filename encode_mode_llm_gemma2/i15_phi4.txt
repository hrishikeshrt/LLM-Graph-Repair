Explanation:
- The patient is allergic to oxycodone, which is an ingredient in Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection.
- Since the patient takes Epogen and is allergic to one of its ingredients (oxycodone), it would be unsafe for them to take this medication. Therefore, the relationship `[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]` should be removed to reflect this inconsistency accurately.
