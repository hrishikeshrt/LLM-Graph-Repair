Explanation: The medication is prescribed from March 15, 1992 to March 14, 1992, which is an inconsistency. Additionally, the patient is allergic to ferrous sulfate but still takes it as a medication, and the medication has an incorrect ingredient (ferrous sulfate). To fix this, we update the end date of the relationship [rm:TAKES_MEDICATION] to be March 14, 1992, remove the allergy relationship [ra:ALLERGIC_TO], and delete the incorrect relationship [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT].
