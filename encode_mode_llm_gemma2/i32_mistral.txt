Explanation: The inconsistency lies in the fact that oxycodone (Ingredient i) is incorrectly listed as an ingredient of Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection, and patient cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1 is allergic to oxycodone. To resolve this inconsistency, we should update the ingredient of Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection to be correct (i.e., remove oxycodone as an ingredient), and delete the allergy relationship between the patient and oxycodone since it is no longer accurate.
