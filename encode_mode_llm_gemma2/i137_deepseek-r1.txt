Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. So, from what I understand, there's a patient who takes a medication called verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet. This medication has an ingredient called naproxen. But wait, the same patient is also marked as allergic to naproxen. That doesn't make sense because if you take something that contains an ingredient you're allergic to, it should cause a reaction.

Looking at the code provided, I see two relationships: one from the patient (a708bca4-8fc9-...) to the medication via [ra:ALLERGIC_TO], and another from the medication to the ingredient naproxen via [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]. Then, there's a separate relationship where the patient takes the medication. 

So, the problem is that the patient has an allergy to naproxen, which is in the medication they're taking. This creates a contradiction because if you take a medication with an allergen you're allergic to, it should be flagged as such.

To fix this, I think we need to remove the [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] relationship between the medication and naproxen. That way, the patient's allergy isn't tied to an ingredient they actually consume.
