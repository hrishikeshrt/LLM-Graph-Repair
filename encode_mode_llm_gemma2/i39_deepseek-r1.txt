Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, there are two nodes: one patient (6398) and a medication (6786). The medication has an ingredient (6776), which is mestranol. Also, the patient is allergic to this ingredient, so there should be an 'allergic_to' relationship between the patient and the ingredient.

Looking at the relationships:
- The patient takes the medication from 1992 to 1993.
- The patient has an allergy to the ingredient.

Wait a minute. If the patient is taking the medication that contains the allergen, then having an 'allergic_to' relationship between the patient and the ingredient makes sense because the medication includes that allergen. So why is there a conflict?

Maybe the issue is with the timing of when the allergy was recorded or if it's outdated. Perhaps the allergy information should be updated to reflect the correct date range.

So, I think we need to update the 'allergic_to' relationship so that it only applies from 1992-05-17 onwards, after the patient started taking the medication. That way, the allergy is correctly associated with the period when the medication was being used.

I'll plan an UPD_EDGE operation on the [ra] relationship to set its properties to start at '1992-05-17T09:59:52Z'. This should fix the inconsistency by ensuring the allergy is correctly linked to the relevant period of medication use.
