Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The user provided a Cypher query that's returning some nodes and relationships. The main issue seems to be with the allergy information for a patient. Specifically, there are two relationships: one where the patient is allergic to oxycodone (node 6757) and another where the patient takes a medication called Epogen (node 6846). But looking at the details, I see that both of these relationships have the same timestamp.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the patient is taking Epogen from 2015-01-30T09:55:43Z to the same time, that's just a single point in time. It probably should be a duration or maybe an indefinite period. So the issue here is likely that the end date isn't set correctly.

In the query result, the patient takes the medication from the same start and end time, which might imply they started taking it at that exact moment but didn't stop. That's not realistic because medications usually have a duration. Therefore, the end relationship should be updated to reflect an indefinite period instead of the same timestamp as the start.

So, I need to adjust the end date property from the 'rc' relationship (which is HAS_INGREDIENT) so that it has an indefinite end time. This way, it correctly represents the patient's medication intake without being a zero-duration event.
