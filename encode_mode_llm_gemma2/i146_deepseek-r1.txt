Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this graph inconsistency. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the description, there are three nodes: Patient 6400, Medication 6703, and Ingredient 6660. The relationships between them are set up in a way that seems conflicting.

First, the medication node (6703) has an edge of type HAS_INGREDIENT pointing to the ingredient node (6660). That makes sense because medications often have ingredients. Then, there's another relationship from the patient (6400) to the ingredient via ALLERGIC_TO. This suggests that the patient is allergic to the ingredient.

But wait, if the medication has an ingredient, and the patient is allergic to that same ingredient, does it make sense for the patient to be connected directly to the medication? Or should the allergy be at the ingredient level instead?

Looking at the relationships:
- Patient 6400 -[TAKES_MEDICATION]-> Medication 6703
- Patient 6400 -[ALLERGIC_TO]-> Ingredient 6660

This setup implies that the patient is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they're allergic to. However, in many medical systems, allergies are tracked at the ingredient level rather than per medication.

So, perhaps the correct structure should be:
- Patient takes a medication.
- The medication has an ingredient.
- The patient is allergic to that specific ingredient.

In this case, there's no direct relationship between the patient and the medication via ALLERGIC_TO. Instead, the allergy should be linked to the ingredient.

Therefore, I think we need to remove the ALLERGIC_TO relationship from the patient to the ingredient because it's redundant or incorrect in this context. The correct approach would be to link the patient to the medication and then have the medication connected to its ingredients, with each ingredient having its own allergy information if needed.

So, the suggested repair is to delete the edge of type ALLERGIC_TO between Patient 6400 and Ingredient 6660.
