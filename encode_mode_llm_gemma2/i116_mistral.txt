This repair suggests that the allergy information for the patient is incorrect, so we remove the allergy relationship and update the ingredient properties of both the medication and the ingredient nodes to indicate that oxycodone is not an ingredient in Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. Additionally, we add a new NOT_IN_INGREDIENT relationship from oxycodone to the medication node to reflect this change.
