Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the description again.

The problem seems to be with the relationships between the nodes. The medication Humulin 70/30 is connected to both an ingredient mestranol and an allergy to it by the same patient. That doesn't make sense because if someone takes a medication, they shouldn't have an allergic reaction to one of its ingredients unless there's a specific reason.

Looking at the query, I see that both [rc: HAS_INGREDIENT] and [ra: ALLERGIC_TO] relationships are present between the same patient node (6012) and the ingredient node (6776). This duplication is causing the inconsistency because having two separate edges from the same patient to the same ingredient would imply multiple issues, which isn't accurate.

So, I think the solution is to remove one of these relationships. Since the patient can only be allergic to one ingredient at a time, we should eliminate either the HAS_INGREDIENT or ALLERGIC_TO relationship. 

I'll choose to delete the HAS_INGREDIENT edge because if someone has an allergy, they typically don't take the medication as it could cause harm. Therefore, removing this edge will correct the inconsistency.
