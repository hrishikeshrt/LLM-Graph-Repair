In this case, the patient is allergic to oxycodone but also takes a medication that contains oxycodone as an ingredient. To fix this inconsistency, we update the allergen property of the Ingredient node (target: i) and remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient (op_code: UPD_NODE and DEL_EDGE respectively).
