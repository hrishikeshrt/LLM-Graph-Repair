The inconsistency in the graph pattern arises because a patient is allergic to an ingredient that is part of a medication they are taking. This situation suggests either an error in recording allergies or medications, as it would be unusual for a patient to continue taking a medication containing an allergen.

To resolve this issue factually:

1. If the allergy information is incorrect and should not exist:
   - Remove the relationship indicating that the patient is allergic to the ingredient.
   
2. Alternatively, if the medication information is incorrect (e.g., wrong ingredient listed):
   - Remove the relationship between the medication and its supposed ingredient.

Given these options, the most straightforward repair assuming the allergy data is correct would be:

```xml
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
```

This operation removes the erroneous relationship indicating that the medication contains the allergen. If further investigation suggests the allergy information should not exist, then removing the allergic relationship might be appropriate instead. However, based on the provided description, correcting the medication's ingredient list seems more aligned with resolving potential data entry errors in pharmaceutical records.
