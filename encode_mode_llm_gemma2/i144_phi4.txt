The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that a patient is allergic to an ingredient, Olmesartan, which is part of a medication they are taking. To resolve this inconsistency, we need to ensure that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen.

Here's how we can address the issue:

1. **Remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen**:
   - We will delete the edge `[rm:TAKES_MEDICATION]` between the patient and the medication `Tribenzor`, which contains Olmesartan, to prevent the patient from taking a medication they are allergic to.
