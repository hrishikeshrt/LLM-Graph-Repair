Based on the following description of an inconsistency
suggest graph repairs to fix it:

        Node [6757] is labeled as an Ingredient and has the property id: oxycodone. Node [6846] is labeled as a Medication with code 205923 and description 1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. Node [6203] is labeled as a Patient with address 1081 Orn Street, birthdate 1913-05-30, last name Brekke496, first name Logan497, death date 2009-05-02 and id cae10920-f977-48b4-a0d3-4d70ad561fd1.  There is an edge from Node [6846] to Node [6757] with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:52036 and type HAS_INGREDIENT. There is an edge from Node [6203] to Node [6757] with key 5:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:970 and type ALLERGIC_TO.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide suggested repairs in the following structured format:

<repairs> {op_code} | {target} | {details} </repairs>

where:
- {op_code} is one of (`ADD_NODE`, `ADD_EDGE`, `DEL_EDGE`, `UPD_NODE`, `UPD_EDGE`)
- {target} specifies the affected node or relationship variable
- {details} contains relevant property changes (key-value) or `-` if none

Do NOT add explanations beyond the descriptions in the output.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1: (e.g., if the allergy information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>

EXAMPLE OUTPUT #2: (e.g., if the ingredient information is incorrect)
<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
</repairs>
