   </repairs>

The first repair operation updates the ingredient property of the Ingredient node to 'Epogen', since it appears that there is an error in the reported ingredient. The second repair operation removes the allergy relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes, as the patient should not be allergic to Epogen (the updated ingredient).
