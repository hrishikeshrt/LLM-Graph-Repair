The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern suggests that a patient is allergic to an ingredient, mestranol, which is part of a medication, Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, that the same patient takes. This situation indicates a potential risk for the patient due to their allergy.

To address this inconsistency factually and ensure patient safety, we should consider removing the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen. This action does not alter the factual data about the medication's composition or the patient's allergies but rather corrects the potentially harmful situation by preventing the patient from taking a medication they are allergic to.
