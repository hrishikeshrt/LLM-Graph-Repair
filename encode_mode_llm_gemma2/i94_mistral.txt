Explanation: The patient is allergic to the medication, but the medication does not have any allergens specified. To fix this inconsistency, we remove the allergy relationship and update the medication node to include an empty list for allergens. This allows us to maintain a factually accurate graph while preserving other relationships as they are correct in this case.
