The inconsistency identified is that a patient who is allergic to an ingredient (oxycodone) is taking a medication (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) that contains this ingredient. To resolve this, we need to ensure the patient does not take medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.

This operation removes the relationship where the patient takes the medication containing the allergen. Further investigation may be needed to find an alternative medication for the patient that does not contain oxycodone.
