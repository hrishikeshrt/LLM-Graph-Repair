   Explanation: The patient (p) is allergic to the ingredient (i), but the graph does not show this relationship. To fix the inconsistency, we add a new allergen for the ingredient and create an edge between the ingredient and the patient. Additionally, we update the property of the ingredient node to include the patient as an allergen.
