The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern is that a patient who is allergic to an ingredient is taking a medication that contains that same ingredient. To resolve this, we need to ensure that patients are not prescribed medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.

Here are the suggested repairs:

1. Remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication that contains the allergen.
2. Optionally, update or add notes for medical review regarding alternative treatments.

These operations ensure the graph reflects a safer prescription practice by removing the problematic medication from the patient's treatment plan. Further actions, such as finding an alternative medication, would be handled outside of this graph repair process.
