Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

From the description, it looks like there are two nodes: one for Humulin 70/30 and another for mestranol. Both are ingredients of a medication (m:Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension) with code '106892'. But that doesn't make sense because a medication usually has one main ingredient, not two.

Also, the patient is allergic to both Humulin and mestranol. Wait, but if Humulin is an ingredient of the medication, can the same patient be allergic to both? That seems possible, but maybe there's something else wrong here.

Looking at the relationships: the patient (b656a85d-637d-458a-abd8-17219816280f) has an edge [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] pointing to both Humulin and mestranol. But since they're both ingredients of the same medication, having two separate edges might not be necessary.

So, maybe the issue is that the patient is allergic to both, but if Humulin is part of the medication, perhaps the allergy should only be noted once or in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the medication shouldn't have multiple ingredients when it's the same as another node.

I think the key here is that the medication has two separate ingredient relationships pointing to two different nodes, which might not be intended if they are actually the same or related incorrectly.

So, perhaps we should remove one of these edges. Since both are pointing to different nodes but have the same code, maybe only one should remain. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in how the ingredients are listed.

Another thought: Maybe the patient can't be allergic to two different ingredients unless they actually are different substances. But if the medication has multiple active ingredients, that could make sense. However, in this case, both are listed as separate nodes but under the same medication, which might not be accurate.

Wait, looking at the details again: [Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6786] (Humulin...) has code '106892', and [Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:6776] is mestranol, also with the same code. That seems suspicious because each medication usually has a unique code.

So perhaps the code should be different for each ingredient if they are separate. Alternatively, maybe the code is shared incorrectly here.

But regardless, the main problem seems to be that the patient has two HAS_INGREDIENT relationships pointing to two different nodes which might not be intended or correct in this context.

To fix it, I think we can remove one of these edges so that there's only one HAS_INGREDIENT relationship. Alternatively, if both are necessary and accurate, maybe we should leave them as is, but the inconsistency arises from having multiple edges for the same code.

So, perhaps removing one edge would correct this inconsistency. Let's say we remove the edge pointing to mestranol.
