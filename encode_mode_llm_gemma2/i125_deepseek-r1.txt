Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me read through the problem again.

So, there's a patient who took a medication called "205923" which is an oxycodone (E954) 1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection. The patient is allergic to E954, but in this case, the allergy is listed under another node, which might be incorrect.

Looking at the relationships:
- The patient takes the medication (rm relationship)
- The medication has an ingredient (rc relationship) pointing to E954
- The patient is allergic to E954 via a different edge (ra)

This duplication seems wrong. Allergies shouldn't point directly from the patient to the same node as their medication if that's where they're allergic.

So, I think we need to remove the allergy relationship because it's pointing to the same node as the medication's ingredient. That way, the patient is only associated with taking the medication and not having an allergy to its component.
