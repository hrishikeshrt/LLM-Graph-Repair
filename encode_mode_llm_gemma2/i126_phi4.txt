The inconsistency arises because the patient is allergic to an ingredient, oxycodone, which is part of a medication they are taking. This situation suggests that either:

1. The patient should not be taking the medication due to their allergy.
2. The ingredient information might be incorrect.

Given the scenario, it seems more likely that there's an error in how the relationships or properties are defined rather than removing critical medical data without further context. Here are two possible repair suggestions:

**Option 1: Remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication**

**Option 2: Update the ingredient information if it's incorrect (assuming oxycodone is not actually an ingredient in Epogen)**

Choose one of these options based on additional context or verification from medical records.
