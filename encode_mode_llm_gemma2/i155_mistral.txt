This repair suggests updating the node with the allergen's ID to reflect that it is indeed the correct ingredient (cecb7ece-fb70-4a7f-b51d-6e8dd1506ad9), and then removing the relationship between the allergen and the medication, since the allergen should not be an ingredient in the medication it is allergic to.
