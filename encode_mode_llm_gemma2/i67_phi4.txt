The inconsistency in this scenario arises because a patient who is allergic to an ingredient ("epoetin alfa") is taking a medication that contains this same ingredient. To resolve this, we need to ensure the patient does not take medications containing ingredients they are allergic to.

Here's how to address the inconsistency:

1. Remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection" since it contains an allergen for the patient.
