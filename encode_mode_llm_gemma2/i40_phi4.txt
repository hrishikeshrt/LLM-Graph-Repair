The inconsistency identified in the graph pattern suggests that a patient who takes Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension is also allergic to one of its ingredients, mestranol. This presents a potential risk or contradiction since patients should not take medications containing substances they are allergic to.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to ensure that the patient does not have an allergy relationship with mestranol if it is confirmed that Humulin 70/30 does indeed contain mestranol and there is no medical reason for the patient to be taking it despite the allergy. Assuming that the medication's ingredient list is correct and the patient should not be allergic to any of its ingredients, we will remove the allergy relationship.

Here are the suggested graph repairs:

This operation removes the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and mestranol. If further investigation reveals that the allergy information is accurate, alternative solutions may be required, such as updating medication plans or confirming ingredient lists.
