Explanation: The patient is allergic to the ingredient, but the medication containing that allergen is being taken by the patient. To fix this inconsistency, we update the node for the allergen to indicate it's not an allergen (UPD_NODE), update the relationship between the patient and the allergen to stop at the same time as when it started (UPD_EDGE), and update the relationship between the patient and the medication to start after the current timestamp and continue indefinitely (ongoing) (UPD_EDGE).
