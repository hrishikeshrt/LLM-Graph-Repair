This contradicts, as a person cannot be allergic to an ingredient they are taking. To resolve this inconsistency, we mark metformin as allergenic (UPD_NODE) and remove the relationship between metformin and the medication as an ingredient (DEL_EDGE). However, since the medication still needs to have an ingredient, we set the quantity of the relationship to 0 instead. This way, the graph remains accurate without losing any information about the medication itself.",
