Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, there are two nodes that both have the same ID but different properties: one is an Ingredient and the other is a Medication named HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet. That doesn't make sense because a medication shouldn't also be considered an ingredient of itself.

Looking at the relationships, the Patient node (6408) has both a "TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship to the medication node and an "ALLERGIC_TO" relationship to the ingredient node. But wait, if the medication is the same as the ingredient, that's confusing. Maybe the medication shouldn't have an ingredient relationship because it's itself.

So, I think the problem is that there are two nodes with the same ID but different types. To fix this, we should probably remove one of them so they don't both exist in the graph. Since the medication node has a more specific name and uses, maybe we should keep that one and delete the ingredient node.

Alternatively, if for some reason the medication isn't supposed to have an ingredient relationship, we could also adjust those relationships or even remove the "TAKES_MEDICATION" edge entirely. But removing both nodes might not be necessary unless they're conflicting in a way that's causing issues elsewhere.
