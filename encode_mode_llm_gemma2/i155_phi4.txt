Explanation:
- The inconsistency arises because the patient (Node 4:e00e4730-b338-4d2b-b715-75b0e15ece93:5589) is taking a medication (24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet) that contains an ingredient (ferrous sulfate) to which they are allergic.
- To resolve this, the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication should be removed. This prevents the prescription of a medication containing an allergen for the patient.
