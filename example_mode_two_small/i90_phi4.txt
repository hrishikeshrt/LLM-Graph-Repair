To address the inconsistency where a patient named Logan497 takes a medication containing an allergen to which they are allergic, we need to remove either the relationship indicating that Logan497 takes the medication or the relationship indicating that Logan497 is allergic to the ingredient. Here are two possible repair strategies:

1. Remove the relationship indicating that Logan497 takes Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension.
2. Remove the relationship indicating that Logan497 is allergic to mestranol.

Here are the suggested repairs for each strategy:

**Strategy 1: Remove the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship**
