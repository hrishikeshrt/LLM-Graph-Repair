Explanation: The current graph indicates that the patient Logan497 is allergic to oxycodone and takes a medication containing oxycodone. To fix this inconsistency, we should remove the relationship between the patient and the medication (rm), update the ingredient node for oxycodone to indicate it's not the one causing the allergy, and add a new relationship between the patient and the actual allergenic medication (new_i).
