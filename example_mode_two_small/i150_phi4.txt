To address the inconsistency where a patient, Valrie435, is taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic, we need to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes this specific medication. This will prevent the system from suggesting or confirming that Valrie435 should continue taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension containing mestranol.
