In this case, the medicine that Walker122 is taking contains an ingredient he is allergic to. To fix the inconsistency, we remove the relationship between Walker122 and the incorrect medication (op_code=DEL_EDGE, target=[rm]), update the properties of the incorrect medication to reflect a corrected ID and description (op_code=UPD_NODE, target=[m]), add a new "NOT_TAKES_MEDICATION" relationship between Walker122 and a corrected version of the medicine (op_code=ADD_EDGE, target=[p]). The corrected medication's properties should be updated to avoid further inconsistencies.
