Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user has a query that's returning some relationships between patients, medications, and ingredients. The issue is that a patient is taking a medication which contains an ingredient they're allergic to. That's not allowed because it could cause harm.

Looking at the code provided:

They have a match pattern where a patient (p) takes a medication (m), which has an ingredient (i). Then, p is also allergic to i. So, in the graph, there are two relationships: rm connects p to m, rc connects m to i, and ra connects p to i.

The problem here is that the medication contains an ingredient that the patient is allergic to. This violates the rule against treating someone with a medicine containing an allergen they're sensitive to.

So, how can we fix this? Well, if the system detects that a patient is taking a medication with an allergenic ingredient, it should remove the relationship between the medication and the ingredient. That way, the graph won't show that the medication contains something the patient is allergic to.

I think the best approach is to delete the edge [rc] which connects the medication (m) to the ingredient (i). This will remove the incorrect association from the graph.

So, I'll suggest using the DEL_EDGE operation on the relationship variable rc, and since there's no change needed to any properties, just specify that the details are empty.
