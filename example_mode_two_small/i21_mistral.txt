Explanation: To resolve the inconsistency, we first need to remove the incorrect relationship between `p` and `i` (allergy). Then, since the medicine description includes an incorrect ingredient, we update the medicine node with the correct information. In this case, I assumed that the medicine's actual ingredient is different from oxycodone.
