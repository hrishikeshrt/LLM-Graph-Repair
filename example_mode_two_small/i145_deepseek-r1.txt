Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

From the description, a person named Samatha845 is taking a medication that contains an ingredient he's allergic to. That's not supposed to happen because medications with allergenic ingredients should be avoided. The current setup has relationships between Patient (p), Medication (m), Ingredient (i), and AllergicTo (ra). 

Looking at the graph query, it matches p taking m, which has i as an ingredient, and p is allergic to i via ra. But this creates a situation where the medication contains an allergenic ingredient that the person is allergic to.

I think the problem here is that there's no direct relationship between the medication (m) and the ingredient (i). So, the system isn't aware that m contains i. If we add that edge, it would show that the medication has the allergenic ingredient, which should prevent Samatha845 from taking it.

So, I'll need to add an edge between m and i with a type like CONTAINS. That way, the graph explicitly states that the medication contains the allergen, which aligns with the constraint provided.
