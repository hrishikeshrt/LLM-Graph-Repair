The first repair operation removes the relationship between the Medicine node and the Ingredient node, as the medicine in question (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension) does not contain mestranol. The second repair operation updates the Patient node to remove the allergy to mestranol since it is no longer relevant.
