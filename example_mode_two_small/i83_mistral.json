This is because a patient should not be allergic to an ingredient they are taking. In this case, it seems that the patient is incorrectly marked as allergic to 'epoetin alfa', which is an ingredient in the medication they take. The repair assumes that there may be other allergies for the patient and removes only the incorrect one.",
