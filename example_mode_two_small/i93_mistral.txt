Explanation: The current graph shows that the patient Logan497 is allergic to an ingredient (mestranol) which is part of a medication (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension). To fix this inconsistency, we first remove the relationship between the medicine and the allergen ingredient (repair 1), then update the properties of the medicine node to reflect that it does not contain mestranol as an ingredient and change its id for uniqueness (repair 2).
