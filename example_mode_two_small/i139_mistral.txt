      DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
      UPD_NODE | [p] | {allergies: filter(x in p.allergies where x != 'naproxen')}
   </repairs>

   Explanation:
   - Remove the relationship between Patient and Medication (rm) since a person should not be taking a medicine they are allergic to.
   - Update the properties of the Patient node by removing 'naproxen' from the allergies list, as it is incorrect for Weldon459 to be allergic to this ingredient.
