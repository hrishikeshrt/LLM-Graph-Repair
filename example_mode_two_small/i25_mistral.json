To resolve this, we need to remove the incorrect relationship between the Medicine and Ingredient nodes (`DEL_EDGE` operation on [rc]). Additionally, since it appears that the medicine's description includes the allergen (oxycodone), we should update the medicine node with a corrected description (`UPD_NODE` operation on [m]). The corrected description excludes the allergen.",
