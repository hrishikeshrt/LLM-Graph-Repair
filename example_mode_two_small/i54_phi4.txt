To resolve the inconsistency where a patient, Samantha845, takes a medication containing an ingredient to which she is allergic, we need to remove either the relationship indicating that she takes the medication or her allergy to the ingredient. Since it's more logical to assume the allergy information is correct and should be respected, we will remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship.
