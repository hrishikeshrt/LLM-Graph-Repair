To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove either the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication or the one indicating the allergy. Since it's generally safer to avoid administering medications with known allergens rather than assuming an incorrect allergy record, we will focus on removing the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship.
