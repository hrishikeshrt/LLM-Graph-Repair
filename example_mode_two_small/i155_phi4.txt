To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove either the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication or the allergy relationship. Here's how you can resolve it:

1. **Remove the medication intake relationship** if the patient should not take this medication due to their allergy:
   ```plaintext
   <repairs>
   DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
   </repairs>
   ```

2. **Alternatively, remove the allergy relationship** if there was an error in recording the allergy and it does not exist:
   ```plaintext
   <repairs>
   DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
   </repairs>
   ```

Choose one of these operations based on the context or additional information about whether the medication intake should be discontinued or if the allergy record is incorrect.
