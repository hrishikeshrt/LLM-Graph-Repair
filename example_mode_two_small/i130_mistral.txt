Explanation: The inconsistency lies in the fact that a patient (p) takes a medication (m) containing an ingredient (i) which they are allergic to. To fix this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the medicine (rm), since it is incorrect for the patient to be taking the medication. Then, we update the description of the medication to reflect that it does not cause an allergy for this specific patient (Reyna401).
