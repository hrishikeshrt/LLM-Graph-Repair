Explanation: The inconsistency lies in the medicine (m) having an ingredient (i: oxycodone) that the patient (p) is allergic to. To fix this issue, we remove the relationship between the Medicine node and Ingredient node (DEL_EDGE), as the medicine does not contain oxycodone. Then, we update the properties of the Medicine node (UPD_NODE) to reflect that it no longer contains oxycodone.
