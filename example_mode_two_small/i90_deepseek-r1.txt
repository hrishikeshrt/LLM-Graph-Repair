Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user has a Cypher query that's matching a patient taking a medication which contains an ingredient they're allergic to. The issue is that the system shouldn't allow someone to take a medicine with an allergen present in it. So, if both the medication and the ingredient are connected through their relationships, there's a conflict.

Looking at the example given: the patient (p) takes Humulin 70/30, which has mestranol as an ingredient. The patient is allergic to mestranol, so this should be caught and corrected.

In the graph, we have two relationships: rm connects p to m, rc connects m to i, and ra connects p to i. But according to the rule, a person shouldn't take a medicine that contains an allergen they're allergic to. So either the allergy relationship (ra) should be removed or the ingredient in the medication should not exist.

I think the best way is to remove the ra edge because if p is allergic to i, then m shouldn't have i as an ingredient. Alternatively, we could also update the rc edge so that i isn't present in m's ingredients, but removing the relationship might be more straightforward.

So, I'll suggest deleting the ra edge between p and i.
