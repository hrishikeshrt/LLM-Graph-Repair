   </repairs>

The first repair operation removes the relationship between the Ingredient node and the Medicine node, since the ingredient (exemestane) should not be part of the HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet. The second repair operation updates the properties of the Medicine node to reflect that it does not contain the allergenic ingredient (exemestane).
