Explanation: The current graph shows that the patient Boyd728 is allergic to an ingredient (mestranol) which is in the medicine Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension. To fix this inconsistency, we remove the relationship between the patient and the ingredient mestranol (DEL_EDGE), update the patient node to remove the allergy information (UPD_NODE), add a new allergy for Boyd728 with mestranol but mark it as removed since it was incorrectly assigned before (ADD_EDGE).
