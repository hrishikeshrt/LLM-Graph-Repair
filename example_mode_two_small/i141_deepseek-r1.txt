Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The query shows that a patient (p) is taking a medication (m), which has an ingredient (i). The patient is also allergic to this same ingredient (i). That's not good because taking a medication with an allergen they're sensitive to can be dangerous.

Looking at the relationships, there are two edges: rm connects p to m, rc connects m to i, and ra connects p to i. But according to the problem statement, the patient should not have both [rm] (medication taken) and [ra] (allergic to ingredient). So either one of these connections shouldn't exist.

I think the best approach is to remove the [ra] edge because it's directly showing that the patient is allergic. That way, there's no confusion between taking the medication and being allergic to its component.
