To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove either the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication or the relationship indicating the patient's allergy to the ingredient. Here are two potential repair strategies:

### Strategy 1: Remove the Medication Relationship

If it is determined that the patient should not take this medication due to their allergy, we can delete the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship.

### Strategy 2: Remove the Allergy Relationship

Alternatively, if it is found that the allergy information is incorrect or outdated (e.g., the patient has been tested and is no longer allergic), we can delete the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship.

Choose one of these strategies based on the correct factual scenario.
