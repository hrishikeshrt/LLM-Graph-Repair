To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove either the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication or the relationship indicating the allergy. Here are two possible repair strategies:

1. Remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship.
2. Remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship.

### Repair Option 1: Remove `TAKES_MEDICATION`
