This repair suggests removing the allergy relationship between Terrence276 and exemestane, updating the medication's takes_allergy property to '-', adding a new ingredient node with an unspecified id, and creating a CONTAINS relationship between the updated medicine and the newly created ingredient. This repair assumes that the medicine does not contain exemestane, but Terrence276 is not allergic to another ingredient in the medicine.
