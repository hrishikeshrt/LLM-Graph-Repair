Explanation: The patient Earle679 is currently allergic to mestranol, but should not be. To fix this inconsistency, we remove the allergy (`DEL_EDGE`) from the patient-ingredient relationship and update the patient's allergies list by filtering out mestranol (`UPD_NODE`). Since the medication the patient is taking does not need to be changed, we do not modify the `rm` edge.
