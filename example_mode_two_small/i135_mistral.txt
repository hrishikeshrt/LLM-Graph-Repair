Explanation: The inconsistency is that the patient (Boyd728) takes a medicine (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension) which contains an ingredient (mestranol) they are allergic to. To fix this, we first remove the relationship between the medication and the ingredient (DEL_EDGE). Then, we remove the allergy information for the patient (UPD_NODE), since it is incorrect. After that, we add a new relationship between the patient and the ingredient (ALLERGIC_TO) to reflect the correct state of affairs. Finally, we update the ingredient node with the allergy information (mestranol).
