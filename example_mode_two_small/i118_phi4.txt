To address the inconsistency where a patient is taking medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to, we need to remove either the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication or the relationship indicating the allergy. Since it's generally safer to avoid prescribing medications with known allergens, removing the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship is appropriate.
