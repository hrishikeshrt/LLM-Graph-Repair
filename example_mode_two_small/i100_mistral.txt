   DEL_EDGE | [rc] | {id: mestranol}
   UPD_NODE | [p] | {allergic_to: "-"}
   </repairs>

Explanation for the suggested repairs:
1. Remove the relationship between Medicine and Ingredient (`[rc]`) as the medicine should not contain an allergen for the patient.
2. Update the Patient node (`[p]`) to remove the allergy to mestranol (`{allergic_to: "-"}`) since it seems there was a mistake in the data provided.
