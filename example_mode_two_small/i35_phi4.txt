This repair suggests removing the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient Sanford861 and the medication Plavix 75 MG Oral Tablet, as it contains an ingredient (clopidogrel) to which the patient is allergic. This action prevents the patient from being treated with a medicine containing an allergen they are sensitive to.
