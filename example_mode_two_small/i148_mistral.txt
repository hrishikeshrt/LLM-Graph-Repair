   </repairs>

In this case, we remove the relationship between the Medicine and Ingredient (`rc`) because it appears that the ingredient (mestranol) is incorrect for the given medicine (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension). Then, we update the property of the Ingredient node to indicate that it is no longer allergic to the patient (Valrie435). This repair corrects the inconsistency by removing the allergy and adjusting the ingredient information for the medicine.
