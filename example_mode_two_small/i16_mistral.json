To fix the inconsistency, we should remove the relationship between m and i (DEL_EDGE), update the properties of m to reflect that it no longer contains oxycodone (UPD_NODE), add a new node for oxycodone as an ingredient of m (ADD_EDGE), and update the id of the newly created node to match the original value of i (UPD_NODE).",
