Here's the explanation for the suggested repairs:
1. Remove the relationship between `p` and `m` (rm) since a person should not be taking a medicine that they are allergic to.
2. Update the ingredient node with incorrect information (i) by removing its id property, as it is causing the inconsistency.
3. Add a new node representing the correct allergy for the patient (new_i).
4. Update the newly created allergy node (new_i) with the correct ingredient name (epogen).
