   </repairs>

This repair suggests removing the relationship between the Ingredient and Medication nodes (oxycodone and Epogen), updating the description of the Medication node to remove the incorrect ingredient, adding a new NOT_ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes for oxycodone. This repair assumes that the patient is not actually allergic to oxycodone but was incorrectly labeled as such in the graph.
