To address the inconsistency where a patient named Samantha845 is taking a medication that contains an ingredient she is allergic to, we need to remove either the relationship indicating she takes the medication or her allergy to the ingredient. Since it's generally safer to avoid prescribing medications containing allergens rather than ignoring known allergies, we will opt to remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship.
