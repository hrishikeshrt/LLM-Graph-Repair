Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to remove the incorrect medication (m) that Walker122 is taking and update the description of the medicine with a correct one. Since there are two relationships involving Walker122, Medicine, and Ingredient, it's unclear which relationship is causing the inconsistency. However, considering the textual description provided, it seems more likely that the medication (m) should not have been administered to Walker122 in the first place due to an allergy. Therefore, we suggest removing the relationship between Walker122 and the medicine (rm). This repair will ensure that the graph is factually accurate and consistent.
