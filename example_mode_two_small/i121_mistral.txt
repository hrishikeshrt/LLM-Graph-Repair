This repair suggests updating the medication node with an incorrect description to include both the drug name (oxycodone) and its description. It then removes the existing allergy relationship between the patient and ingredient nodes since the patient is not actually allergic to the medicine (mislabeled ingredient). Lastly, it adds a new allergy relationship between the patient node and the correct oxycodone ingredient node.
