This repair operation removes the relationship between the patient `Marcellus830` and the medication `24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet`, as the person is allergic to an ingredient in this medicine. This ensures that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen they are sensitive to.
