Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Oxycodone (DEL_EDGE, [ra]) because a person should not be allergic to a medicine they are taking.
- Update the Medicine node for the incorrect medicine taken by Sanford861 to remove the oxycodone ingredient from its description (UPD_NODE, [m]).
- Add a new medicine (ADD_EDGE, [p]->[rm2]) that does not contain any allergenic ingredients for Sanford861. This new medicine will have an empty ingredient property (UPD_NODE, [m2], {ingredient: "-"}) and be related to the correct Ingredient node through a HAS_INGREDIENT relationship (ADD_EDGE, [m2]->[rc2]).
