This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient Terrence276 and the medication HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet, as it contains an ingredient (exemestane) to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that Terrence276 does not continue taking a medication with an allergen.
