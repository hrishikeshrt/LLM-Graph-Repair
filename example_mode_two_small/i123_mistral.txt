Explanation: The inconsistency is that the patient (Sanford861) is taking a medicine (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection) which contains an ingredient (oxycodone) that they are allergic to. To fix this, we remove the relationship between the patient and the medicine (rm), update the medicine's properties to include the allergen (oxycodone), and add a new relationship between the patient and the allergen (ALLERGIC_TO).
