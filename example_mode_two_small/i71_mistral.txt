The first repair operation updates the relationship `rm` (TAKES_MEDICATION) to remove the allergy information. The second repair operation removes the existing relationship `ra` (ALLERGIC_TO). This fixes the inconsistency by allowing the patient to take a medicine that does not contain an ingredient they are allergic to.
