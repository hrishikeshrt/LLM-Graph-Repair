Explanation: The medicine (m) should not contain the allergen (i), so we remove the relationship between the Medicine and Ingredient nodes (DEL_EDGE [rc]). Since the description of the medicine includes the allergen, we need to update the medicine node with the correct ingredient information (UPD_NODE [m]).
