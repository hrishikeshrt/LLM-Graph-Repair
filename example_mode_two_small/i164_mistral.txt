      UPD_NODE | [p] | {allergicTo: "-"}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests removing the relationship between the medication and the ingredient (`DEL_EDGE`) because the ingredient (mestranol) should not be part of the medicine if the patient is allergic to it. Additionally, the allergy information for the patient (Kendal125) needs to be updated to reflect that they are no longer allergic to this particular ingredient (`UPD_NODE`).
