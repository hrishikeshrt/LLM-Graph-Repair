Explanation: The inconsistency is that a person (p) takes a medicine (m) which contains an ingredient (i) they are allergic to. To fix this, we remove the relationships between p and m (rm and rc), add the missing ingredient (fluticasone) to the medicine (m), and update the patient's allergy information by removing fluticasone from their allergies (p.allergic_to: ['-']).
