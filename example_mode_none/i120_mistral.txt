Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationships between Patient, Medication, and Ingredient as they are inconsistent.
- Add a new Medicine node 'm' with description "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection". This medicine will not contain oxycodone (as stated in the description).
- Add relationships between Patient, Medicine, and Ingredient for the newly created Medicine node. The patient should take this new medicine 'm' and it should have no ingredient 'i'.
