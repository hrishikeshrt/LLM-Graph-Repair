This operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient "Isiah14" and the medication "24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet," as it contains an ingredient "ferrous sulfate" to which the patient is allergic. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen.
