Explanation:
- Remove the relationship between Patient and Medication (rm) as the patient should not be taking this medication.
- Remove the relationship between Medication and Ingredient (rc) as the ingredient is no longer part of the medication after being identified as an allergen.
- Add a new node for Mestranol as an Allergen (i').
- Establish a new ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient and the new Mestranol node (i').
- Update the existing ALLERGIC_TO relationship with the original Ingredient node to indicate that it is indeed an allergen.
