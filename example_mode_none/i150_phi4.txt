Explanation:
- The inconsistency arises because a patient, Valrie435, is taking a medication (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension) that contains an ingredient (mestranol) to which she is allergic. 
- To resolve this, the relationship indicating that Valrie435 takes Humulin 70/30 should be removed, as it's unsafe for her to take this medication due to her allergy to mestranol.
- The operation `DEL_EDGE` is used to remove the relationship `[TAKES_MEDICATION]` between the patient and the medication.
