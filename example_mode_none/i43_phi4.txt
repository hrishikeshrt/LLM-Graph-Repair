This repair operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient Cassandra224 and the medication Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet, as she is allergic to one of its ingredients. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that Cassandra224 does not take a medication containing an ingredient she is allergic to.
