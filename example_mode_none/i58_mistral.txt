This repair removes the incorrect relationship between `Sanford861` and `24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet`, as well as the relationship between these nodes and `ferrous sulfate`. Then, a new node for `ferrous sulfate` is added with the property `allergen: true`. Finally, the properties of `Sanford861` are updated to include `ferrous sulfate` in its allergies.
