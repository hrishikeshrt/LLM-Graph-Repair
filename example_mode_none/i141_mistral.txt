Explanation: The inconsistency is that a person (Marcellus830) takes a medicine (24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet) which contains an ingredient (ferrous sulfate) that the person is allergic to. To fix this, we remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medication, and between Medication and Ingredient. Then, we add a new node for ferrous sulfate as an allergen for Marcellus830, and update the property of ferrous sulfate to indicate it is an allergen.
