Explanation:
- Remove the relationship between Patient and Medicine (rm) as Walker122 should not be taking Epogen.
- Remove the relationship between Medicine and Ingredient (rc) as Epogen does not contain epoetin alfa if it is an allergen for Walker122.
- Add a new node for epoetin alfa (i') as it was not present in the graph before. Since it is an allergen for Walker122, set its allergicTo property to ['epoetin alfa'].
- Update Patient's allergicTo property to include 'epoetin alfa'.
