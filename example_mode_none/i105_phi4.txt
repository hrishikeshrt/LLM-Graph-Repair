Explanation:
The inconsistency arises because a patient named Sanford861 is taking medication that contains an ingredient (oxycodone) to which they are allergic. To resolve this, we need to remove the relationship indicating that Sanford861 takes the medication containing oxycodone. This operation ensures that the graph reflects only safe medical treatments for the patient.
