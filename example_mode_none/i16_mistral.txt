This repair suggests removing the relationship between the patient and the medicine (`rc`) because the medicine contains an ingredient that the patient is allergic to. It also removes the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient (`ra`). This repair assumes that the patient can still take the medicine without the specific ingredient, but without the allergy information, it's impossible to confirm this assumption.
