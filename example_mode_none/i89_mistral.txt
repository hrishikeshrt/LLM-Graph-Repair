Explanation: The inconsistency is that a patient (Walker122) is taking a medicine that contains an ingredient he is allergic to. To fix this, we remove the relationships between Walker122, the medication, and the ingredient. Then, we add the allergen property for the ingredient "epoetin alfa" and update the patient's allergies list to include it.
