This repair operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient "Sanford861" and the medication "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection", as it contains an ingredient ("oxycodone") to which the patient is allergic. This ensures that the patient is not treated with a medicine containing an allergen they are sensitive to.
