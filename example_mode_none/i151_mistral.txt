Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationships `rm`, `rc`, and `ra` as they represent the inconsistency.
- Add a new node `i'` for metformin, marking it as allergenic since Teddy976 is allergic to it.
- Create a new relationship between the updated patient node `p'` and the newly created ingredient node `i'`, indicating that Teddy976 is allergic to metformin.
