This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between Patient and Medication, as well as the one between Patient and Ingredient, since the patient should not be taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. It then adds a new node for the allergen (epoetin alfa) and establishes a relationship between the patient and the allergen.
