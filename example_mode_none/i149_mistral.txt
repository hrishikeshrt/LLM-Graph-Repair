This repair suggests updating the `rc` edge (HAS_INGREDIENT) to mark mestranol as an allergen for Valrie435, and then removing the existing relationship between Valrie435 and Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension. This will correct the inconsistency by ensuring that Valrie435 is not allergic to any ingredient in the medicine she takes.
