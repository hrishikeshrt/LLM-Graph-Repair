This repair operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient "Sanford861" and the medication containing "oxycodone," which is an ingredient to which the patient is allergic. This addresses the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient does not take a medication with an allergenic ingredient.
