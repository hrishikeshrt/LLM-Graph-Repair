Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to remove the relationship between `Patient` and `Medication`, as well as the relationship between `Medication` and `Ingredient`. Additionally, since the patient is no longer allergic to the ingredient, we update the `allergic_to` property of the patient node accordingly.
