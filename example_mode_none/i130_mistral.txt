Explanation:
1. Remove the existing relationship between Patient (Reyna401) and Medication (24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet), as well as the relationship between the same patient and the ingredient (metformin).
2. Create a new node for the medicine, with a different id (i.e., glucophage) to avoid confusion. This medicine will not contain metformin, so it is not allergic to the patient.
3. Add a relationship between the patient and the new medicine, indicating that the patient is allergic to this new medicine.
4. Update the properties of the new medicine node to reflect its correct id and description.
5. Update the properties of the ingredient (metformin) node to indicate that it is now allergic to the patient (Reyna401).
