Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medication (rm) as Walker122 should not be taking this medication.
- Remove the existing relationship between Medication and Ingredient (rc) as the medicine does not contain the ingredient anymore due to allergy.
- Add a new node for the ingredient "epoetin alfa" and mark it as allergic to Walker122.
- Update the Patient node to indicate that Walker122 is allergic to epoetin alfa.
