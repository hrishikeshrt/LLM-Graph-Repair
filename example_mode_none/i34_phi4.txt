This repair operation removes the existing `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient Logan497 and the medication containing oxycodone, which is an ingredient to which Logan497 is allergic. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that Logan497 is not treated with a medicine containing an allergen.
