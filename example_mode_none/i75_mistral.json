Then, add a new node for the ingredient 'epoetin alfa' if it does not exist. After that, create a new relationship between the patient and the newly created or existing ingredient node to represent the allergy. Finally, update the Medicine node with the correct description and include the ingredient in its containsIngredient property.",
