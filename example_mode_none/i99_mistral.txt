This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between Earle679 and Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension (rm) and its related ingredient (rc). Then, it adds a new node for mestranol as an allergen for Earle679. Lastly, it sets the removed property of the relationship between Earle679 and mestranol to false, ensuring that this relationship persists.
