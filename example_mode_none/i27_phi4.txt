This repair operation removes the existing `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient "Logan497" and the medication containing "oxycodone," which is an ingredient to which Logan497 is allergic. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that Logan497 does not take a medication with an allergen.
