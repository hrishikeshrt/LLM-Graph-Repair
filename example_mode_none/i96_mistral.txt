This repair suggests removing the existing relationships between Earle679, Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, and mestranol. Then, it adds a new node for mestranol with the property "allergic_to" set to Earle679. Lastly, it updates Earle679's "allergic_to" property to remove the entry for mestranol. This way, the graph accurately represents that Earle679 is allergic only to mestranol, and not taking any medicine containing mestranol.
