Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationships between Sanford861, Epogen (m), and Oxycodone (i) as they are inconsistent.
- Add a new node 'epogen' representing Epogen medication with the correct description.
- Add a relationship between Sanford861 and the newly created epogen node for taking the medicine.
- Add a relationship between the newly created epogen node and a new ingredient node 'epogen_ingredient' (which does not cause an allergy to Sanford861).
