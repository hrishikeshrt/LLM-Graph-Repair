This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between Patient and Medication, as well as the relationship between the Medication and Ingredient. Then, it adds a new node for the ingredient "epoetin alfa" with the property `allergenic: true`. Lastly, it adds a new relationship between the patient and the newly created allergenic ingredient node. This repair assumes that the patient's allergies are stored in a separate node.
