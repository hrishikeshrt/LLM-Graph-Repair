Explanation: The inconsistency arises because a patient named Logan497 is taking a medication, Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, which contains an ingredient (mestranol) that the patient is allergic to. To resolve this issue, we should remove the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient and the medication, as it is not safe for the patient to take this medicine due to their allergy.
