Explanation: The inconsistency arises because a patient named Isiah14 is taking a medication that contains an ingredient (ferrous sulfate) to which they are allergic. To resolve this, we should remove the relationship indicating that Isiah14 takes the medication containing ferrous sulfate. This operation ensures that Isiah14 is no longer associated with taking a medication they're allergic to.
