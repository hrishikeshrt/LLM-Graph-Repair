It then adds a new node for the ingredient 'Epoetin Alfa' that the patient is allergic to, and creates a relationship between the patient and this new ingredient node. This repair corrects the inconsistency by removing the incorrect medication-ingredient relationship and adding a correct allergy relationship.",
