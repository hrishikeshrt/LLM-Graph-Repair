Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between `p` and `m` (rm) as the patient should not take this medication.
- Remove the existing relationship between `m` and `i` (rc) as the medicine does not contain oxycodone.
- Add a new node for Epogen (i') as it is the correct medication that Logan497 takes.
- Establish a new allergy relationship between `p` and Epogen (ra').
- Establish a new ingredient relationship between `m'` (the corrected version of m) and Epogen (rc').
- Remove oxycodone as an ingredient from the medicine description for m'.
- Update the medication description for m' to '1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection'.
