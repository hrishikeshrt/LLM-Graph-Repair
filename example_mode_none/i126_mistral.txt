This repair operation modifies the relationship between the Ingredient node and the Medication node to indicate that the ingredient is not an allergen for the patient, and removes the AllergicTo relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes. This change makes the graph consistent with the given description that a person should not be treated with a medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to.
