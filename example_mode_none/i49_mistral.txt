This repair suggests removing the existing relationships between Terrence276, HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet, and Exemestane. Then it adds a new node for Exemestane (since it was not present in the original graph) and marks Terrence276 as not allergic to Exemestane. Finally, it adds a relationship between Terrence276 and the newly created Exemestane node. This repair fixes the inconsistency by removing the incorrect medication and updating Terrence276's allergy information.
