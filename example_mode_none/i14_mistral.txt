Explanation: The patient is currently taking a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To fix this inconsistency, we remove the relationship between the patient and the current medication (rm and rc edges), add a new allergen for the patient (epogen in this case), and update the graph with the correct medication that the patient is not allergic to (i').
