This repair suggests removing the existing relationships between Sanford861, the medication, and the ingredient (oxycodone), as they are inconsistent. Then, it adds a new node for Epogen (the correct medication) and establishes a new relationship indicating that Sanford861 is not allergic to Epogen.
