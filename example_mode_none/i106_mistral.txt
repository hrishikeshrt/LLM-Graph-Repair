Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medication (rm) as the patient should not be taking this medication.
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Ingredient (rc) as the medicine does not contain the allergenic ingredient initially.
- Add a new node for Epogen, which is the correct medication that the patient should be taking.
- Establish a new allergy relationship between the patient and Epogen (ra').
- Establish a new takes_medication relationship between the patient and the correct medication (rm').
- Update the description property of the new medicine node to match the original description.
