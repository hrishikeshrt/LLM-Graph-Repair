This repair operation removes the existing `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient "Samatha845" and the medication "Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG / Olmesartan medoxomil 20 MG Oral Tablet [Tribenzor]" to resolve the inconsistency where Samatha is allergic to an ingredient (olmesartan) in this medication.
