This repair operation removes the existing relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient Isiah14 and the medication 24 HR Glucophage 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet, as it contains an ingredient (ferrous sulfate) to which the patient is allergic. This correction ensures that Isiah14 does not take a medication containing an allergen.
