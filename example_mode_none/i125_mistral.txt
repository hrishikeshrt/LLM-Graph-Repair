This repair suggests removing the relationship between Patient (Sanford861) and Medicine (1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection), as well as the relationship between the same patient and Ingredient (oxycodone). Additionally, it updates the allergy property of the patient to be empty. This repair assumes that the patient is no longer allergic to oxycodone or that the medicine has been replaced with a non-allergenic version.
