Explanation:
- Remove the edge `rm` (TAKES_MEDICATION) since the patient should not be taking the medication.
- Remove the edge `rc` (HAS_INGREDIENT) because the ingredient is no longer part of the medicine after it has been identified as an allergen.
- Add a new node `i'` for mestranol, marking it as an allergen.
- Add a new edge `ra'` (ALLERGIC_TO) between the patient and the newly created allergen node.
