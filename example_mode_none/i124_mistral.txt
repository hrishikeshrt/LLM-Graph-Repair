Here is the explanation of the suggested repairs:

1. Remove the existing relationship between Patient (p) and Medicine (m) (rm and rc operations).
2. Remove the existing relationship between Patient (p) and Ingredient (i) (rm and rc operations).
3. Add a new Ingredient node (i') with id 'epogen' and name 'Epogen'.
4. Create a new relationship between the updated Patient node (p') and the newly created Medicine node (m').
5. Create a new relationship between the newly created Medicine node (m') and the newly created Ingredient node (i').
