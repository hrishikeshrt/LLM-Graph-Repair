This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between Walker122 (Patient) and 1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection (Medication), as well as the relationship between the same patient and Epoetin Alfa (Ingredient). Then, it adds a new node for Epoetin Alfa with the appropriate id and name. Lastly, it updates Walker122's allergies property to include "epoetin alfa".
