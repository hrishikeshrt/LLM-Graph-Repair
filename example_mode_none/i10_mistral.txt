      UPD_EDGE | rc | {allergic: false}
      DEL_EDGE | ra | {node: p, relationship: rc}
   </repairs>

Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to update the relationship between the Medicine and Ingredient node to indicate that the patient is not allergic to this ingredient (`UPD_EDGE` operation). Additionally, since the patient being allergic to the ingredient was incorrectly recorded in the first place (`ra` relationship), it needs to be removed (`DEL_EDGE` operation).
