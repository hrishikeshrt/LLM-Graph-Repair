Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to remove the existing relationships between Valrie435, Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension and mestranol (since a person should not be allergic to an ingredient they are taking). Then, update Valrie435's allergy information by removing mestranol from the list of allergies. Finally, add a new relationship between Valrie435 and mestranol to reflect that she is now allergic to mestranol.
