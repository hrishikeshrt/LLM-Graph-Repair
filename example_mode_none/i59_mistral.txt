Explanation:
- Remove the relationship between Patient (p) and Medicine (m) as the patient should not be taking this medication.
- Remove the relationship between Patient (p) and Ingredient (i) as the patient is no longer allergic to the ingredient if they are not taking the medicine containing it.
- Add a new node for the same ingredient (ferrous sulfate) but mark it as an allergen.
- Add a relationship between the updated Patient (p') and the newly created Ingredient (i') indicating that the patient is allergic to this ingredient.
