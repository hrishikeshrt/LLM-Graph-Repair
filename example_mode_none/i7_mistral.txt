This set of repairs suggests removing the relationship between Earle679 (p) and HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet (m), as well as the relationship between HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet (m) and exemestane (i). Additionally, it removes the allergy to exemestane from Earle679's properties. This will ensure that Earle679 is no longer shown as allergic to an ingredient in a medication they are taking.
