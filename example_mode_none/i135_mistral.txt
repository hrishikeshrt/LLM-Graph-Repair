   Explanation:
   - Remove the edge between `p` and `i` (`DEL_EDGE`) as a person should not be allergic to an ingredient they are taking.
   - Update the relationship between `m` and `i` (`UPD_EDGE`) by removing the `HAS_INGREDIENT` property for the allergenic ingredient `mestranol`.
   - Update the properties of node `p` (`UPD_NODE`) to reflect that the person is no longer allergic to `mestranol` by filtering it out from the `allergies` list.
