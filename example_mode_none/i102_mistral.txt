This repair suggests removing the relationship between the patient and the medication (rm) and the relationship between the medication and the ingredient (rc), as the patient should not be taking a medicine that contains an allergen. Additionally, since the patient is no longer allergic to the removed ingredient, the allergy property for the patient node is also updated.
