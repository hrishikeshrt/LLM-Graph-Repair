Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient (p) and Medicine (m) (rm and rc edges) since Logan497 should not be taking a medicine containing an ingredient he is allergic to.
- Add a new node for Epogen, which is the actual medication that Logan497 should be taking instead of oxycodone.
- Establish a relationship between Logan497 and Epogen (p' and m') as he is not allergic to this medicine.
- Also, create a relationship between Epogen and the ingredient 'epogen' since it actually contains this ingredient.
- Finally, establish a relationship between Logan497 and the ingredient 'epogen' (p' and i') since he is allergic to it.
