This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between Patient and Medication, as well as the relationship between Medication and Ingredient. It also adds a new allergy for the patient (Samatha845) to olmesartan, which is the ingredient in the medication she's currently taking. This repair corrects the inconsistency by removing the medicine that contains an allergen from the patient's list of medications and updating her allergies accordingly.
