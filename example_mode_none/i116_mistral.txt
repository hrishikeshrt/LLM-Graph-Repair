Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient (`DEL_EDGE` operation) since a person should not be allergic to an ingredient they are taking. Additionally, since there is no medication that contains oxycodone in this case (as per the description), we update the quantity of the relationship between the medicine and the ingredient to -1 (`UPD_EDGE` operation) to reflect that the medicine does not contain the allergenic ingredient anymore.
