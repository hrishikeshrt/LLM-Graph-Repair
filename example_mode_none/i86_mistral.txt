This repair suggests removing the existing medication and ingredient relationship, adding a new node for Epoetin Alfa as an ingredient, and establishing an allergy relationship between the patient and Epoetin Alfa. This should correct the inconsistency where a person is taking a medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to.
