Explanation: To resolve the inconsistency, we need to remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient (`ra`), update the medication description to exclude the allergenic ingredient (`m`), and since there is no actual medication with oxycodone as an ingredient in this case, we are updating the medication description to reflect that it does not contain oxycodone.
