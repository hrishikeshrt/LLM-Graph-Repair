Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medication (rm) as the patient should not be taking this medication.
- Remove the existing relationship between Medication and Ingredient (rc) as the medicine does not contain the allergenic ingredient.
- Add a new node for Epogen, which is the actual medication being taken by the patient.
- Establish an allergy relationship between the patient and Epogen (ra').
- Establish a HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between the newly added Epogen node and the correct ingredient (oxytocin in this case).
