Explanation: The inconsistency arises because a patient, Astrid395, is taking medication verapamil hydrochloride 40 MG Oral Tablet that contains an ingredient (naproxen) to which she is allergic. To resolve this issue, the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between Astrid395 and verapamil hydrochloride should be removed. This operation ensures that Astrid395 no longer takes a medication containing an allergenic ingredient.
