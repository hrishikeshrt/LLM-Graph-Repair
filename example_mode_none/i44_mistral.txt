This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between Cassandra224 and Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet, as well as the relationship between Cassandra224 and chlorthalidone (the ingredient in question). Additionally, it updates Cassandra224's allergic_to property to be an empty string, indicating that she is no longer allergic to anything.
