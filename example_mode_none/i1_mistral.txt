Explanation: The inconsistency arises because the patient is taking a medication that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. To fix this, we remove the relationship between the Patient and Medication nodes (rm and rc edges), add the allergen property for the Ingredient node (exemestane), and update the Patient's allergies property to include 'exemestane'.
