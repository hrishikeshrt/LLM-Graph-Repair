This repair suggests removing the relationship between Cassandra224 and Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet (rm) and its associated ingredient (rc), as well as updating Cassandra224's `takes_medication` property to exclude Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet. This repair assumes that there are no other medications taken by Cassandra224 that do not contain chlorthalidone, and that the allergy information is correctly represented in the graph.
