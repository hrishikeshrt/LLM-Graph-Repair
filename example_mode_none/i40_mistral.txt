This repair suggests removing the relationship between Moises22 (p) and Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension (m), as well as the relationship between mestranol (i) and both p and m. Additionally, it updates Moises22's allergic_to property to remove mestranol. This repair assumes that the graph does not have any other relationships for these nodes that would conflict with this change.
