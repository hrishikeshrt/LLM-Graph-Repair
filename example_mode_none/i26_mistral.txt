This repair suggests removing the existing relationships between `Logan497`, `Medication` and `Ingredient`, as they are inconsistent with the fact that `Logan497` is allergic to the ingredient in question. Additionally, it updates the description of the medicine to reflect that it is now oxycodone-free.
