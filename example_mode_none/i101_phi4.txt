This operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient Earle679 and the medication Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension, which contains an ingredient (mestranol) to which the patient is allergic. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that the patient does not take a medication containing an allergen.
