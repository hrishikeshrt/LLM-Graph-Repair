Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to remove the existing relationships between Sanford861, the medication (Epogen), and oxycodone (the allergen). Then, add a new relationship for Sanford861 being allergic to Epogen. Lastly, create a new node for the correct medication (Epogen) with its properties updated accordingly.
