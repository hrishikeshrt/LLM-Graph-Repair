Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient (p) and Medication (m) (rm and rc operations) as the patient should not take a medication containing an allergen.
- Add a new node for the allergen (i') with the property 'id' set to 'mestranol' and 'allergen' set to true.
- Add a relationship between Patient (p') and the newly created Allergen node (i') using the ALLERGIC_TO edge type.
- Add a relationship between the new Medication node (m') and the newly created Allergen node (i') using the HAS_INGREDIENT edge type. This represents that the medication contains the allergen.
