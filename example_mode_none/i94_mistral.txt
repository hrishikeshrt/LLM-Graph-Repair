Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient (p) and Medication (m) (rm, rc) since the patient should not be taking a medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to.
- Add a new node for the allergen (i') with appropriate properties.
- Add a new relationship between the new allergen node (i') and the modified Medication node (m') indicating that the medication does contain the allergen (rc).
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient (p) and Ingredient (i) (ra) since it is incorrect.
- Add a new relationship between Patient (p) and the new allergen node (i') to indicate that the patient is not allergic to this specific ingredient (rn).
