Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to remove the existing relationships between Walker122 (p), the medication (m), and the ingredient (i). Then, we add a new node for the same ingredient (epoetin alfa) but mark it as allergic to Walker122. Finally, we create a relationship between Walker122 and the newly created allergen node.
