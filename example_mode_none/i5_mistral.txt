Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationships between Earle679, HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet, and exemestane (`rm`, `rc`) to reflect that Earle679 should not take this medicine.
- Create a new node for HCTZ without exemestane as an ingredient (`i'`). The id is changed to 'HCTZ' and the description is set to '25 MG Oral Tablet'.
- Establish a relationship between Earle679 and the new HCTZ node (`m'`) to reflect that Earle679 should take this corrected version of HCTZ.
