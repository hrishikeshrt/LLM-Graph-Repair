This repair operation removes the existing `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient "Samatha845" and the medication "Amlodipine 5 MG / HCTZ 12.5 MG / Olmesartan medoxomil 20 MG Oral Tablet [Tribenzor]", which contains an ingredient "olmesartan" to which the patient is allergic. This resolves the inconsistency by ensuring that Samatha845 does not take a medication containing an allergen.
