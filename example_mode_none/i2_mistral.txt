Explanation:
1. Remove the existing relationship between Patient (p) and Medicine (m) (rm and rc operations).
2. Add a new node for the allergen ingredient (exemestane) with the property `allergen: true`.
3. Establish a new relationship between the patient and the newly created allergen ingredient node (ALLERGIC_TO).
4. Establish a new relationship between the medicine and the newly created allergen ingredient node (HAS_INGREDIENT).
