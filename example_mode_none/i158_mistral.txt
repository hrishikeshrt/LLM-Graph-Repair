Explanation:
1. Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medication (rm) as the patient should not be taking this medication.
2. Remove the existing relationship between Medication and Ingredient (rc) as the ingredient is no longer part of the medication after removal of the medication.
3. Add a new node for the same ingredient (ferrous sulfate) but mark it as an allergen (allergen: true).
4. Create a new relationship between the patient and the newly created allergen node (i').
