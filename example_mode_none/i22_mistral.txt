Explanation: To resolve the inconsistency, we need to update the existing relationships `rm` and `rc` to reflect that Logan497 is not allergic to Epogen (oxycodone was incorrect) and Epogen does not contain oxycodone. Additionally, we add a new medicine (Epogen) for Logan497 and mark it as not allergic. Lastly, we update the ingredient id of the allergy relationship `ra2` to reflect that Logan497 is allergic to Epogen instead of oxycodone.
