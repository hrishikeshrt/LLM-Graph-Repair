This repair removes the incorrect relationship between `Logan497` and `1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection`, as well as the relationship between that medicine and its ingredient `oxycodone`. It then adds a new relationship between `Logan497` and `oxycodone` to reflect his allergy. Finally, it updates the description of the medicine to correctly state that it does not contain oxycodone.
