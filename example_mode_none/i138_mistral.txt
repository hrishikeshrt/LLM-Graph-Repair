Explanation:
1. Remove the existing relationship `rm` (TAKES_MEDICATION) between the patient and the medication, since the patient should not be taking this medicine.
2. Remove the existing relationship `rc` (HAS_INGREDIENT) between the medication and the ingredient, as the medication does not contain this ingredient anymore in our corrected graph.
3. Add a new node for the allergen 'naproxen', since it was incorrectly assumed to be an ingredient of the medicine.
4. Update the patient node with the correct list of allergies, including 'naproxen'.
