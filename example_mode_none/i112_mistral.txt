Explanation:
1. Remove the existing relationship between Patient (p) and Medicine (m) as the patient should not be taking this medicine.
2. Remove the existing relationship between Patient (p) and Ingredient (i) as the patient is not allergic to this ingredient.
3. Add a new Medicine node (m') with the correct description, which is not causing an allergy to the patient.
4. Replace the old Medicine node (m) with the new one (m') in the relationship between Patient (p) and Medicine (m').
5. Add a new Ingredient node (i') for the medicine that the patient is actually taking, which is not causing an allergy to the patient.
