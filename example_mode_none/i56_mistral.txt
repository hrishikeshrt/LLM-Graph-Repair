Explanation:
- Update the relationship `rc` (HAS_INGREDIENT) between `m` and `i` to remove ferrous sulfate as the ingredient of Demerol 50 MG Oral Tablet.
- Delete the existing relationship `ra` (ALLERGIC_TO) between `p` and `i`. This is because a person cannot be allergic to an ingredient that is not part of any medication they take.
- Add a new relationship `ALLERGIC_TO` from `p` to the Demerol 50 MG Oral Tablet (as it contains an allergen for this patient).
