Explanation:
1. Update the relationship `rm` (TAKES_MEDICATION) for the patient to remove the allergy to the medication.
2. Update the relationship `rc` (HAS_INGREDIENT) for the medication to remove the ingredient associated with it, as it is not actually present in the medicine.
3. Add a new node 'oxycodone' for the ingredient that the patient is allergic to.
4. Update the patient node with the allergy to the newly added ingredient 'oxycodone'.
5. Add a relationship between the medication and the newly created ingredient node, associating it with the medicine.
