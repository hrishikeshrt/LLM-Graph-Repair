Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient (`DEL_EDGE` operation), as it is not accurate that the patient is allergic to the ingredient in question. Additionally, since the patient should not be taking a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to, we update the medication-patient relationship to indicate that the patient is no longer taking this medication (`UPD_EDGE` operation with `allergy: false` property).
