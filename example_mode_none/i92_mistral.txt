      UPD_EDGE | rm | {allergic: false }
      UPD_NODE | p | {first: "Logan497", allergies: ["mestranol"]}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the `rm` relationship to remove the allergy, and updating the `p` node to correctly reflect that Logan497 is allergic to mestranol. The second repair operation also includes an update to the `allergies` property of the patient node to make it a list, allowing for multiple allergies to be stored.
