      UPD_EDGE | rc | {allergic: false}
      DEL_EDGE | ra | {nodeId: Earle679, ingredientId: mestranol}
   </repairs>

Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient (`DEL_EDGE` operation), and update the edge connecting the ingredient and the medication to indicate that the patient is not allergic to it (`UPD_EDGE` operation).
