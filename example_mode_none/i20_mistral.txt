Explanation: The inconsistency is that a patient is taking a medication containing an ingredient they are allergic to. To resolve this, we remove the relationships between the patient and the medicine, and the patient and the ingredient. We also update the ingredient node to indicate it's no longer an allergen for the patient, and finally, we update the relationship between the patient and the ingredient to reflect the new status.
