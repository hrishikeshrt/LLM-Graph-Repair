This repair suggests removing the existing relationship between Sanford861 and the medicine containing oxycodone, as well as the relationship between that ingredient and the medicine. Then, it adds a new ingredient node for Epogen, marks Sanford861 as allergic to Epogen, and updates the description of the allergy edge accordingly.
