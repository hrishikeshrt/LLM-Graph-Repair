This repair suggests removing the relationship between `Patient` and `Medication` (rm) and between `Medication` and `Ingredient` (rc), as it is inconsistent for a patient to take a medicine that they are allergic to. It also updates the description of the `Medication` node to reflect the corrected ingredient.
