Explanation:
1. Remove the existing relationship between `Patient` and `Medication` (rm) as Teddy976 should not be taking this medication.
2. Remove the existing relationship between `Medication` and `Ingredient` (rc) as the ingredient is no longer part of the medicine after removing the relationship with the patient.
3. Add a new `Medication` node (i') for Glucophage, which is not allergic to Teddy976 but contains metformin (ingredient i').
4. Establish a new relationship between Teddy976 and the new `Medication` node (i') indicating that he is allergic to this medicine.
5. Update the properties of the new `Ingredient` node (i') to reflect that it is Glucophage and is allergic to Teddy976.
