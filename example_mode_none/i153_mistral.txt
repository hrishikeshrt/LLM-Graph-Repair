Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medicine (rm) and the one between Patient and Ingredient (rc), as the patient should not be taking a medicine that contains an ingredient they are allergic to. Then, we add a new node for ferrous sulfate as an allergen for the patient (Isiah14). Finally, we update the patient's properties to include ferrous sulfate in their allergies list.
