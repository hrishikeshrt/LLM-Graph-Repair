Explanation:
1. Remove the relationship between `Patient` and `Medication` (rm) as Logan497 should not be taking Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension.
2. Remove the relationship between `Medication` and `Ingredient` (rc) since the medicine no longer applies.
3. Add a new node for the ingredient Mestranol (i') as it was not present in the original graph.
4. Update the properties of the patient node (p') to remove the allergy to Mestranol.
