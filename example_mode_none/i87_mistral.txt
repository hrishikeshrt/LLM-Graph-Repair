Explanation: To fix the inconsistency, we need to remove the existing relationship between the patient and the medication (since they should not be taking a medicine with an allergen), and also add a new node for the same ingredient but mark it as allergic to the patient. The updated graph will correctly represent that Walker122 is allergic to epoetin alfa, which was in the medicine he was taking.
