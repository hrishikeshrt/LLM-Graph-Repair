Additionally, since the medicine Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension that Moises22 takes contains mestranol, but we are removing his allergy to it, we should also update the relationship between the medicine and the ingredient to reflect that there is no longer any quantity of the ingredient in the medicine (`UPD_EDGE` operation).",
