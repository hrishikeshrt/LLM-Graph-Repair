Explanation:
1. Remove the existing relationship `rm` (TAKES_MEDICATION) between `p` and `m`.
2. Remove the existing relationship `rc` (HAS_INGREDIENT) between `m` and `i`.
3. Add a new node `i'` for Epogen, as it is actually the medication taken by Logan497.
4. Establish an allergy relationship `ra'` between `p` and `i'`.
5. Establish a HAS_INGREDIENT relationship `rc'` between `m` and `i'`, as Epogen has Epogen as its ingredient.
