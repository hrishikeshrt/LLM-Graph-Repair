This repair suggests removing the relationship between `Patient` and `Medication`, as well as the relationship between `Medication` and `Ingredient`, since a person with an allergy to that ingredient should not take that medication. Additionally, it updates the property of the affected patient node to indicate that they cannot take the specified medication.
