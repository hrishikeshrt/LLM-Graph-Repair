Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medicine (rm) as the patient should not be taking the medicine.
- Remove the existing relationship between Medicine and Ingredient (rc) as the ingredient is no longer part of the medicine after being identified as an allergen.
- Add a new node for the same ingredient (mestranol), but now marked as an allergen (isAllergen: true).
- Establish a new relationship between the patient and the newly created allergen node (i').
