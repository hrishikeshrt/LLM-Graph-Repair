To resolve this, we remove the existing relationships between Patient, Medication, and Ingredient nodes (rm:TAKES_MEDICATION and rc:HAS_INGREDIENT). Then, we add a new node for the ingredient 'exemestane' marking it as an allergen. Finally, we create a relationship from the patient to the newly created allergen node using the ALLERGIC_TO relationship type (ra':ALLERGIC_TO'). This repair ensures that the graph accurately reflects the fact that the patient is allergic to the ingredient in the medication they were taking.",
