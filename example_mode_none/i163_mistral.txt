Explanation:
1. The relationship between the patient and the medication should be removed (`rm`) since the patient is allergic to an ingredient in the medication.
2. The relationship between the medicine and the ingredient should also be removed (`rc`) for the same reason.
3. A new node `i'` representing the allergen (mestranol) with the property `allergen: true` is added, so that it can be associated with other allergens in the future.
4. The patient's allergies property is updated to include 'mestranol'.
5. The new node `i'` representing the allergen (mestranol) has a description of 'Mestranol' for consistency with the original data.
