Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, a patient is taking a medication that has an ingredient which they're allergic to. That's not good because it could cause severe reactions. 

Looking at the graph query, there are two relationships: one between the patient and the medication (TAKES_MEDICATION), another between the medication and the ingredient (HAS_INGREDIENT). Also, the patient is connected to the ingredient via an ALLERGIC_TO relationship.

The problem here is that the medication's ingredient exists in the database as a separate node. Since the patient is allergic to this ingredient, they shouldn't be taking that medication. So, logically, we should remove the medication from being taken by the patient.

To fix this, I think we need to delete the TAKES MEDICATION relationship between the patient and the medication. That way, the patient isn't linked to any medication containing an allergenic ingredient anymore. 

So, using the allowed operations, the best approach is to remove that specific edge with the property rm.

<repairs> DEL_EDGE | rm | details: {property: 'rm', value: 'TAKES MEDICATION'} </repairs>

The solution involves removing the TAKES MEDICATION relationship between the patient and the medication. This ensures that the patient is no longer linked to any medication containing an allergenic ingredient.

<repairs> DEL_EDGE | rm | details: {property: 'rm', value: 'TAKES MEDICATION'} </repairs>
