This repair operation removes the relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` between the patient node with `p.first=Sanford861` and the medication node with `m.description=1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection`. This ensures that the patient is not treated with a medicine containing an ingredient they are allergic to.
