Explanation:
1. Remove the existing relationship between `Patient` and `Medication` (rm) as the patient should not be taking this medication.
2. Remove the existing relationship between `Medication` and `Ingredient` (rc) as the ingredient is no longer part of the medicine after removing the medication.
3. Add a new `Ingredient` node (i) for Epogen, which is the correct medication the patient should be taking.
4. Establish a new `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and Epogen (ra2).
5. Establish a new `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the new Epogen node and the ingredient (rc2). This will correctly represent that Epogen contains the ingredient.
