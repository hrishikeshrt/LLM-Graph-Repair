This repair suggests removing the relationship between Cassandra224 and Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet, as well as the relationship between Cassandra224 and chlorthalidone (the ingredient she is allergic to). Additionally, it updates Cassandra224's node to remove Tenoretic 50 Oral Tablet from her list of medications she takes. This repair ensures that Cassandra224 no longer takes the medicine she is allergic to.
