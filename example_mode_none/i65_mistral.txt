Explanation:
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Medicine (rm) as Walker122 should not take this medication.
- Remove the existing relationship between Patient and Ingredient (rc) as the ingredient is no longer associated with the medicine.
- Add a new node for the allergen (Epoetin Alfa).
- Update the patient node to reflect that they are allergic to Epoetin Alfa.
