This repair suggests updating the Ingredient node's id to a non-existent value and removing the existing allergy relationship from the Patient-Ingredient pair. Then, it adds a new allergy relationship between the Patient and the updated Ingredient node with no start or stop dates specified. This repair assumes that the medication (Oxycodone) is indeed an allergen for the patient, but the current data indicates otherwise.
