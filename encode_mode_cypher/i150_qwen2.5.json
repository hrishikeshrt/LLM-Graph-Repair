  "content": "<repairs>\nUPD_NODE | p | {deathdate: \"1981-05-26\"} \n</repairs>\n\nThis repair operation corrects the patient's birthdate and deathdate, assuming the patient cannot be born on the same day they were created. However, given the context of the example, it might be more appropriate to assume the patient was created after their birth date. Therefore, a more accurate correction would be:\n\n<repairs>\nUPD_NODE | p | {birthdate: \"1980-05-26\"} \n</repairs>",
