Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, looking at the provided Cypher query and its output, I see that there are two relationships: one from p to m via rm (TAKES_MEDICATION) and another from p to i via ra (ALLERGIC_TO). The issue is with the ALLERGIC_TO relationship because it has an 'id' property on both sides.

Wait, in the output, the 'i' node has an 'id', which makes sense. But looking at the 'p' node's details, I also see an 'id'. That might be a problem because if p is connected to i via ra (ALLERGIC_TO), having an id on both could create multiple relationships between the same nodes, leading to ambiguity.

So, maybe we should remove the ALLERGIC_TO relationship. By deleting [ra], it would eliminate any conflicting edges from p to i. That way, each node maintains a single identifier without causing inconsistencies in their connections.
