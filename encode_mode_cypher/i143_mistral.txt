      ADD_EDGE | [p, i] | {"type": "ALLERGIC_TO", "tau_o": 1}
   </repairs>

Explanation: The patient's `tau_o` property should be updated to 1 as it is inconsistent with the Ingredient node's `tau_o`. Also, since the patient is not allergic to Olmesartan according to the given data, a new edge `ALLERGIC_TO` should be added between the Patient and Ingredient nodes.
