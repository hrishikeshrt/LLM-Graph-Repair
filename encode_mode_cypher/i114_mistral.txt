Explanation: The initial graph shows that the patient is allergic to oxycodone and also takes a medication (with code 205923) that contains oxycodone as an ingredient. This contradicts the fact that the patient is taking the medication if they are allergic to it.

To fix this inconsistency, we can update the `ra` relationship between the patient and oxycodone to remove the allergy (by setting the "stop" property). However, since the patient is still shown as taking the medication, we also need to:
1. Remove the existing edge between the patient and the medication (rm) by updating its "stop" property.
2. Add a new node for oxycodone with an empty name property.
3. Create a new relationship between the patient and the newly created oxycodone node, indicating that the patient takes oxycodone without an allergy.
4. Update the `ra` relationship between the patient and the newly created oxycodone node to indicate the allergy.
