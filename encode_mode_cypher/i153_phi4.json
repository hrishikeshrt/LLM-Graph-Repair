The relationship `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i)` has an `is_error` property set to `\"1\"`, indicating an error with this connection.\n\nTo resolve this factual inconsistency, we should remove the erroneous relationship between the medication and the ingredient. This will ensure that the graph accurately reflects the correct relationships without errors.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\n</repairs>",
