Alright, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. So, from what I understand, there are two relationships involving the ingredient 'i'. One is via rm:TAKES_MEDICATION and another via rc:HAS_INGREDIENT. 

Looking at the details provided:
- For rm, it has a stop date of 2017-02-17T09:55:43Z.
- For rc, the stop date is an empty string.

Hmm, that seems inconsistent because both relationships should have their own stop dates indicating when they end. The fact that one has a specific date and the other doesn't might be causing issues in the system or data integrity.

So, to fix this, I think we need to standardize the stop dates for both relationships. One way is to set an empty string for rm:TAKES MEDICATION so it matches rc:HAS_INGREDIENT. Alternatively, if setting a specific date isn't necessary, removing the stop dates entirely might be better unless there's a reason they should still have them.

Therefore, I'll suggest updating both edges by adding their stop properties as empty strings. This way, any downstream processes will handle them consistently without errors.
