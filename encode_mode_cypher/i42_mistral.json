However, it appears there is an inconsistency as she is shown as allergic to this ingredient. To fix this, we update the patient node's tau_o property to indicate that she has had a change in state (1 means current), remove the existing allergy edge between the patient and ingredient nodes, and add a new allergy edge between them with an updated tau_o value of 1.",
