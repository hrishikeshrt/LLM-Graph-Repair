Explanation: The patient's birthdate (tau_k in the given data) is 1917, which is before the medication's start date (2014-06-02). To make the data consistent, we should update the patient's tau_o to 1 and adjust the allergy relationship's start and stop dates. The repair operations provided will result in a factually accurate graph.
