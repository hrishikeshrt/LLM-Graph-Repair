Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this graph inconsistency. Let me look at the problem step by step.

First, the query matches a patient taking medication, which has an ingredient relationship. Then it also matches the patient being allergic to an ingredient. The returned results show that the allergy (ra) has empty start and stop times, but the medication (rm) has specific times. That seems inconsistent because if a medication is taken at certain times, an allergy related to that medication should probably have similar timing.

Hmm, maybe the issue is with how the allergy relationship is set up. If the patient is allergic to an ingredient, it makes sense that this would be linked to the same time frame as taking the medication. Otherwise, having no start or stop might imply there's no activity period, which could be incorrect if allergies do occur during medication use.

So perhaps we need to add time information to the allergy relationship. That way, both the medication and allergy have consistent data about when they occurred.
