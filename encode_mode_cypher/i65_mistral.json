So we update the patient node with tau_o=1.\n* The allergy to the ingredient started before the medication was taken, which is inconsistent. We update the start date of the allergy edge to a later date (1974-01-01 in this example).\n* The medication was taken from 1972 to 1972, which doesn't make sense. We extend the duration of the medication by updating the start and stop dates of the medication edge to reasonable values (1974-01-01 for start and 1975-12-31 for stop in this example).",
