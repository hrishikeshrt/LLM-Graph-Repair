Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the query and the result.

The original code matches a patient taking medication, which has an ingredient relationship. Then it also matches the patient being allergic to an ingredient. The result shows that the 'ra' relationship for allergy is empty except for some tau values, while the 'rc' (ingredient) has more details like 'tau_o', 'is_error', and specific properties.

Hmm, I notice that in the result, both 'ra' and 'rc' are present but with different statuses. The 'rc' seems to have a valid description, whereas 'ra' might be problematic because it's empty or not correctly formatted. Maybe the 'ra' relationship isn't capturing all necessary information about allergies.

So, perhaps we should remove the existing 'ra' edge since it doesn't provide useful data and add a new one that includes the correct allergy details. That way, we ensure that any subsequent queries looking for allergies will have accurate information.

I think the steps would be: delete the current 'ra' relationship and then add a new one with proper allergy details. This should fix the inconsistency by removing incorrect or missing data and adding accurate relationships.

DEL_RELATION | [ra] | -
ADD_RELATION | [allergies] | {tau_o: 0, stop: "", start: "", is_error: "0"}
