The inconsistency identified in the query is that a patient (`p`) who is allergic to an ingredient (`i`) is also taking medication (`m`) that contains that same ingredient. This situation could pose a health risk and should be addressed.

To resolve this, we can consider two main approaches:

1. **Remove the Medication**: If the allergy is critical, it might be necessary to remove the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen.
2. **Update Allergy Information**: Alternatively, if there's a possibility of an error in recording the allergy, updating or removing the allergy information could be considered.

Given the potential severity of allergies, the safer approach is to address the medication:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
</repairs> 

This operation removes the relationship indicating that the patient takes the medication containing the allergen.
