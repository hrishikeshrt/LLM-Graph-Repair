The inconsistency arises from the `is_error` property of the `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship (`[rc]`) being set to `"1"`, indicating an error, while there exists a direct allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient. This suggests that either the medication should not contain this ingredient or the allergy information is incorrect.

To resolve this inconsistency factually:

- If the ingredient should indeed be part of the medication, we need to correct the `is_error` property.
- Alternatively, if the patient should not be allergic to this ingredient due to it being a necessary component of their medication, we may consider adjusting the allergy relationship.

Assuming the first scenario where the ingredient is correctly part of the medication:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {is_error: "0"}
</repairs>

If the second scenario is more appropriate (i.e., removing the patient's allergy to this ingredient):

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [ra] | -
</repairs>
