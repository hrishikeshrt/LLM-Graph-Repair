Explanation: The patient Walker122 is allergic to the ingredient epoetin alfa, but there's no edge connecting them. So we need to remove the allergy edge (ra). Additionally, the medication epoetin alfa is not listed in the patient's known allergies (tau_k), so we update the node p with the new known allergen. Lastly, the start date of the takes_medication relationship should be corrected to the next day after the current inconsistent one, as it cannot be earlier than the reported deathdate.
