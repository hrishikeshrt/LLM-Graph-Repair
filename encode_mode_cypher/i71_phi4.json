This situation should be avoided as it poses a health risk.\n\nTo address this, we can suggest removing either the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication or the allergy relationship. Since the primary concern is the health risk posed by the allergy, it would be more prudent to remove the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship (`rm`) to prevent the patient from taking a medication containing an allergen.\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rm] | -\n</repairs>",
