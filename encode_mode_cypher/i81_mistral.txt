   The first repair updates the patient's time of birth to 1 (indicating it is a factual error). The second repair sets the start date for the allergy relationship to a reasonable date prior to the medication intake. The third repair adjusts the start and stop dates of the medication intake relationship to reflect a more realistic duration of treatment.
