Explanation: The patient's birthdate is incorrect (1913-05-30), so we update the patient node with a correct birthdate (assuming the current year as the year). We remove the existing allergy edge between the patient and ingredient since it seems to be in error. Finally, we add a new allergy edge between the patient and the ingredient with a correct time stamp (tau_o: 1).
