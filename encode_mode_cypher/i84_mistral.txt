Explanation: The patient's birthdate (1914-09-06) is incorrect, so we update the patient node with a more accurate birth year. Additionally, since the patient is allergic to epoetin alfa but there is no edge connecting them, we add an edge between the patient and the ingredient node for epoetin alfa.
