Okay, so I'm trying to fix this inconsistency in a graph. Let me look at what's given.

The query matches a patient taking medication, which has an ingredient relationship. There's also a direct allergy between the patient and the ingredient. The returned data shows that the 'ra' relationship has an empty start and stop time, while 'rc' (ingredient) has is_error as 1. 

Hmm, so maybe the 'rc' edge is incorrect because it's marked as error. But wait, in the graph, both relationships are present: one for medication use and another for allergy.

I think the issue might be that the allergy shouldn't have an ingredient relationship since the patient isn't allergic to any ingredients of their medication. So perhaps we should remove the 'rc' edge because it's not accurate. That makes sense because if there was an error, maybe the data is incorrect or irrelevant in this context.

So I'll suggest deleting the 'rc' relationship. Let me check if that's a valid operation. Yes, 'DEL_EDGE' can be used to remove relationships. So the target would be [rc], and since we're just removing it, there are no details needed beyond '-'.

DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
