The relationship `HAS_INGREDIENT` has an error flag (`is_error: \"1\"`), indicating there might be incorrect or incomplete information regarding the ingredient's association with the medication.\n\nTo address this, we should remove the erroneous relationship between the medication and the ingredient. This ensures that any decision-making process based on this graph does not consider potentially harmful associations due to incorrect data.\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\n</repairs>",
