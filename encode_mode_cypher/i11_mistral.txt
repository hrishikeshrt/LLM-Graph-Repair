This repair suggests updating the Ingredient node with a different id to avoid the inconsistency. It also removes the allergy relationship between the patient and the original ingredient since it's incorrect. Lastly, it adds a new allergy relationship between the patient and a new Ingredient node with the correct id ("oxycodone").
