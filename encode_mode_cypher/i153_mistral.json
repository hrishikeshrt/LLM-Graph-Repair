This contradicts the allergy information. To resolve this inconsistency, we update the 'tau_o' property of the ingredient node to indicate that it is incorrect (1), remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient, and do not make any changes to the medication or patient nodes because the medication information seems correct in this case.",
