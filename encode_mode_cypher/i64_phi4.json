The relationship `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT` has an error flag `is_error: \"1\"`, indicating a potential issue with this connection.\n\nTo address this, we should consider removing the erroneous edge and ensuring the patient's allergy information is accurately reflected in their profile or medication plan.\n\nHere are the suggested repairs:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\n</repairs>\n\nThis operation removes the problematic `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship, which has been flagged as an error. Further investigation would be needed to ensure that the patient's allergy information is correctly managed in other parts of their medical record or treatment plan.\n\n",
