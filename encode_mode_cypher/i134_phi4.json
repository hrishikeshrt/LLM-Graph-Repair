This suggests that there is an error with this relationship. Given that the patient `[p:Patient]` is also allergic to the ingredient `[i:Ingredient]`, it's likely that the medication `[m:Medication]` should not contain this ingredient, or the relationship itself is incorrect.\n\nTo address this inconsistency, we can remove the erroneous relationship between the medication and the ingredient:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\n</repairs>",
