The inconsistency identified in the graph involves a medication (`m`) that contains an ingredient (`i`) to which a patient (`p`) is allergic. The relationship `HAS_INGREDIENT` between the medication and the ingredient has an error flag set (`is_error: "1"`), indicating a potential issue with this connection.

To resolve this inconsistency, we should remove the erroneous `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the medication and the ingredient. This operation assumes that the presence of the allergy is correct, but the association of the ingredient with the medication needs correction.

Here are the suggested repairs:
