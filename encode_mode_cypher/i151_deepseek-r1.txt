Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this graph inconsistency. Let's see what the problem is.

First, looking at the provided code and output, it seems like there are some relationships in the graph that might be causing issues. The query involves a patient (p) taking medication (rm), which leads to a medication node (m). That medication has an ingredient (rc) pointing to an ingredient node (i). Additionally, the patient is allergic to the same ingredient (ra).

The returned data shows some inconsistencies. For instance, the 'ra' relationship has both 'start' and 'stop' as empty strings, which probably means it's not set correctly. Also, the 'rm' relationship ends in 1988 with a start date that seems off because medication shouldn't expire after the patient's death in 1995.

So, I think the main issues are:
1. The 'ra' relationship is missing or incorrectly set.
2. The 'rm' relationship has an incorrect expiration date.

To fix these, I should probably remove the incorrect 'rm' edge since it doesn't make sense biologically. Then, update the 'ra' relationship to correctly reflect that the patient is allergic to the medication's ingredient.

I'll use `DEL_EDGE` for the 'rm' and `UPD_EDGE` for the 'rc' relationships because they have tau_o: 0, meaning they're not active or relevant anymore.

DEL_EDGE | [rm] | -
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | stop:-, start:-
