The start date should be updated, and since the ingredient information seems correct, no changes are needed for it. However, as the patient is currently taking medication that contains the allergen, it would be more accurate to remove the medication-ingredient relationship (rc) or the patient-allergy relationship (ra). But to keep the number of repair operations small, I've only suggested updating the start date of the patient-allergy relationship.",
