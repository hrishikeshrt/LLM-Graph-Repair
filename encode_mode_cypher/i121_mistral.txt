The first repair operation updates the `Ingredient` node with a different id. The second repair operation updates the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship's stop and start properties to an empty string, indicating that the allergy is no longer active. This assumes that the patient should not be allergic to oxycodone in this case. If the inconsistency lies elsewhere, the repairs may need to be adjusted accordingly.
