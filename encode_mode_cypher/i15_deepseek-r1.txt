Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, there are two relationships involving the ingredient 'oxycodone'. One is via the 'rm' relationship (TAKES_MEDICATION) and another via the 'rc' relationship (HAS_INGREDIENT). 

First, looking at the 'rm' edge: it has a start and stop time set to "2000-04-03T23:35:03Z", but the tau_o is 0. Tau usually stands for some kind of status or timestamp, so if tau_o is 0, maybe this edge shouldn't exist because it's not properly recorded.

Then, looking at the 'rc' edge: the start and stop times are empty strings, which might mean that there's no time information associated with this relationship. However, the tau_o for this edge is 1, so it should have some valid timestamp. But since the details don't provide any, maybe we can just remove these timestamps to make it consistent.

So, I think the best approach is to delete both edges because they're either improperly recorded or lack necessary information without causing inconsistencies elsewhere.
