   </repairs>

The reason for updating the patient node is to correct the time of creation (tau_o) as it should be 1 since this is a new inconsistency. The second repair operation adds an edge between the patient and allergen ingredient nodes, amoxicillin, since the given data indicates that the patient is allergic to amoxicillin.
