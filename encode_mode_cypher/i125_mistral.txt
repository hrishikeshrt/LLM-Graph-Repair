     UPD_NODE | [i] | {"tau_o": 1, "id": "-"}
     ADD_EDGE | [p]-[:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i) | {"start": "", "stop": "", "tau_o": 0}
   </repairs>

The suggested repairs are to update the Ingredient node with a different id and add an ALLERGIC_TO relationship from the Patient node to the updated Ingredient node. This repair assumes that the current data is incorrect (i.e., the patient is allergic to something other than oxycodone). The new id for the Ingredient node should be unique, but I've used "-" as a placeholder in this example response.
