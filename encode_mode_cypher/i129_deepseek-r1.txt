Okay, so I'm trying to fix this inconsistency in a graph. Let me see what's going on here.

Looking at the code provided, there are two relationships from the patient (p) to medication (m) via rm and then from m to ingredient (i) via rc. Also, p is connected to i via ra, which stands for allergic_to.

The problem seems to be with the 'rc' relationship. The result shows that rc has an 'is_error' property set to "1", but it's also supposed to have a 'tau_o' of 1. Wait, no, looking again, in the returned data, 'rc' has {'tau_o': 1, 'is_error': '1'}, which might be correct if that's intentional.

But then, the 'rm' relationship ends at m, and there's another edge from p to i via ra. So it looks like the patient is connected both to medication (via rm) and directly to the ingredient (via ra). But in reality, a patient shouldn't have an allergic reaction to an ingredient unless they take that specific medication which has the ingredient.

So maybe the 'ra' relationship should be removed because if p takes m via rm, then m has i as an ingredient. So p is already connected to i through m and rm, making ra redundant or incorrect.

Therefore, I think we need to delete the 'ra' edge so that the graph accurately reflects the relationships without duplication.
