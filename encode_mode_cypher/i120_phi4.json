The relationship `ra:ALLERGIC_TO` between the patient and the ingredient indicates an allergy, while the medication still includes this ingredient as per the `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship.\n\nTo resolve this factual inconsistency, we should remove the problematic relationship indicating that the patient takes a medication containing an allergen:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rm] | -\n</repairs> \n\nThis operation removes the `TAKES_MEDICATION` relationship between the patient and the medication, addressing the inconsistency without altering other data unnecessarily.",
