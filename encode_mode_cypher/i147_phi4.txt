The inconsistency identified in the graph involves a patient who is allergic to an ingredient found in a medication they are currently taking. This situation should be flagged as an error, but it appears that only one of the relationships (`ra: ALLERGIC_TO`) has been marked with `is_error` set to "1". To ensure consistency and clarity in the graph data:

- The relationship `[rm: TAKES_MEDICATION]` should also have its `is_error` property updated to reflect this issue.

Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [ra] | is_error = 0
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rm] | is_error = 1
</repairs>
