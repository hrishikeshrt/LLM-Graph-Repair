The inconsistency identified in the query involves a patient being allergic to an ingredient that is part of a medication they are taking. This situation suggests that either the allergy or the medication's ingredients need correction.

To resolve this, we can consider two potential repairs:

1. **Remove the Allergy Relationship**: If the patient is not actually allergic to the ingredient, we should remove the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship.
2. **Update Medication Ingredients**: If the medication should not contain the allergen, we should remove the `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship.

Given that the query indicates an error in the `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship (`is_error: "1"`), it suggests a possible issue with the ingredient data for the medication. Therefore, removing this edge might be more appropriate if the medication should not contain the allergen.

Here are the suggested repairs:

If further investigation confirms that the patient is indeed allergic to the ingredient and should not take the medication, then an additional repair would be:
