Explanation: The given data shows that the patient (p) is allergic to an ingredient (i:oxycodone), but there's no record of this allergy being added correctly. To fix this inconsistency, we first need to remove the incorrect allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient (DEL_EDGE [ra]). Then, we should add a new correct allergy relationship between the patient and the updated ingredient node with the appropriate properties (ADD_EDGE [p, i]). Lastly, we update the property of the removed ingredient node to remove the incorrect id value (UPD_NODE [i]).
