Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

Looking at the provided code, there are two relationships involving the 'i' node: one is the 'rc: HAS_INGREDIENT' between 'm' and 'i', and the other is 'ra: ALLERGIC_TO' from 'p' to 'i'. The problem seems to be that both these edges have empty 'start' or 'stop' values, which might indicate some kind of issue with how these relationships are defined.

The user mentioned an inconsistency, so I'm thinking maybe having two separate relationships when one should suffice could cause issues. Perhaps the 'rc' and 'ra' edges shouldn't both exist because 'i' is already connected through another relationship. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in setting their properties to empty strings.

I'll check each edge:

1. For [rc], it has {'tau_o': 1, 'is_error': '1'}. The 'is_error' field being '1' suggests this edge might be problematic or invalid.
2. For [ra], the 'start' and 'stop' are empty strings, which could mean they were not properly set.

So, maybe both edges need to be removed because their properties are incorrect. Alternatively, if one of them is necessary, perhaps only that should stay.

But since the problem mentions an inconsistency, it's likely that having two separate relationships when one suffices or having invalid edge properties causes issues. Therefore, removing both edges might resolve the inconsistency.
