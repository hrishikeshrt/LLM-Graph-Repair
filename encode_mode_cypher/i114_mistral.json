This contradicts the fact that the patient is taking the medication if they are allergic to it.\n\nTo fix this inconsistency, we can update the `ra` relationship between the patient and oxycodone to remove the allergy (by setting the \"stop\" property). However, since the patient is still shown as taking the medication, we also need to:\n1. Remove the existing edge between the patient and the medication (rm) by updating its \"stop\" property.\n2. Add a new node for oxycodone with an empty name property.\n3. Create a new relationship between the patient and the newly created oxycodone node, indicating that the patient takes oxycodone without an allergy.\n4. Update the `ra` relationship between the patient and the newly created oxycodone node to indicate the allergy.",
