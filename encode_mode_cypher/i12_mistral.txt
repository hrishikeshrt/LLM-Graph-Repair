Explanation: The patient is allergic to oxycodone but it is not reflected in the graph as there is no edge between Patient and Ingredient nodes for allergy relationship. So we will update the ingredient node with a different id, delete the existing Allergic_To edge, and add a new Allergic_To edge between the patient and the updated ingredient node.
