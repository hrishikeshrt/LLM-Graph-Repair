   Here's the explanation for the suggested repairs:
   - Update the Ingredient node with a new id that does not conflict with any existing data. This is to ensure that the inconsistency is resolved without creating new issues.
   - Add an edge between the updated Ingredient node and the Medication node, associating the ingredient with the medication in question. The tau_o property can be set to 1 to indicate that this is a new association.
