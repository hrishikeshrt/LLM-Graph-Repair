Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this graph inconsistency. Let me look at the description provided.

First, there's a match statement that connects a patient (p) to a medication (m), which has an ingredient (i). It also connects the patient to an ingredient directly via 'ra:ALLERGIC_TO'. The result shows some issues with these relationships.

Looking at the returned data, I see that 'rm' is set with start and stop times. But for 'rc', both start and stop are empty strings. That probably means there's a problem with the 'rc:HAS_INGREDIENT' relationship because it should have values if it exists.

Also, the 'ra:ALLERGIC_TO' relationship has an empty string for both start and stop. Since the medication is Metformin from 2017-04-08 to 2017-05-13, these dates don't make sense here. So this edge might be incorrect or incomplete.

I think there are two main issues: one with the 'rc' relationship not having the correct start and stop times, and another with the 'ra' relationship possibly being incorrectly set to empty strings when it shouldn't be.

To fix this, I should remove the 'rc' relationship because it's either non-existent or has incorrect data. Then, for the 'ra' relationship, since Metformin is an ingredient in the medication, that edge should exist with appropriate dates. But looking at the data again, maybe the start and stop shouldn't be empty. Perhaps they were meant to represent when Metformin was taken? If so, those values need to be added.

Wait, but according to the result, 'ra' has both start and stop as empty strings. So it's likely that this relationship is either incorrect or not applicable anymore. Since the medication (metformin) is an ingredient in the medication (m), which is connected via 'rc', maybe the 'ra' edge isn't necessary here because the allergy is already covered by the medication's ingredients.

Alternatively, if the 'ra' was meant to represent a direct allergy between patient and ingredient, but since Metformin is an ingredient, perhaps that relationship shouldn't exist. So removing it would make sense.

So I'll suggest deleting both relationships: one for 'rc' because its start and stop are empty, indicating it's not applicable or missing data, and the other for 'ra' because it might be incorrectly set to empty strings when it should represent a valid allergy if needed.
