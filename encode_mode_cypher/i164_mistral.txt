Explanation: The received data shows that the patient Bartoletti50 is allergic to mestranol (Ingredient i), but there's no edge between Patient p and Ingredient i. To fix this inconsistency, we first update the allergen ingredient with a new unique id, then add an ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient and the updated allergen ingredient.
