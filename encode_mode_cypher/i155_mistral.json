To resolve this, we update the allergy node's `tau_o` property to reflect its existence (1), add a new edge between the Ingredient node (i) and Medication node (m) to show that ferrous sulfate is an ingredient of the medication, and remove the inconsistent relationship between the patient and the allergen (ferrous sulfate).",
