The inconsistency identified in the graph involves a patient (`p`) who is both taking medication (`m`) that contains an ingredient (`i`) and being allergic to the same ingredient. This situation suggests either an error in recording allergies or medication details.

To address this, we can consider two potential repairs:

1. If the allergy information is incorrect (e.g., the patient is not actually allergic), remove the allergy relationship.
2. If the medication intake should not include this ingredient due to the allergy, remove the medication-ingredient relationship.

Given these options, here are the suggested repairs:
