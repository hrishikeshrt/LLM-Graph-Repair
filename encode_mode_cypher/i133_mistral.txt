The first repair operation updates the Ingredient node's `tau_o` property to 1, indicating that this ingredient is indeed an allergen for the patient. The second repair operation removes the allergy relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes, as it seems incorrect based on the updated Ingredient node properties.
