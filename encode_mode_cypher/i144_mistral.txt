    UPD_NODE | [p] | {"tau_o": 1}

Explanation: The patient node's `tau_o` property should be updated to 1 (indicating the patient takes medication), and a new relationship `TAKES_MEDICATION` is added between the Patient and Medication nodes with an appropriate start date. No edge needs to be deleted, as there are no incorrect relationships in this case.
