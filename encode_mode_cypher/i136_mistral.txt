The patient is allergic to naproxen (as indicated by the `ra` relationship), but the medication they are taking does not contain naproxen (indicated by the `rc` relationship). To fix this inconsistency, we update the allergy information for the patient (to correctly reflect that they are allergic to naproxen) and remove the incorrect relationship between the patient and the medication's ingredient.
