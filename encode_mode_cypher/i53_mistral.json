The medication taking relationship's stop date is incorrect, so it needs to be corrected to a later date. Additionally, since the patient appears to have an allergy to warfarin, a new ALLERGIC_TO relationship should be added between the patient and the ingredient node for warfarin (with its time of observation updated as well).",
