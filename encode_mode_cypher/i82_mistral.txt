Explanation: The patient (p) is allergic to the ingredient of the medication they take, which is inconsistent. We remove the allergy relationship (ra) and update the patient's known allergies (tau_k). Also, the start time of taking the medication (rm) should only have a start date without a stop date since it appears that the patient is still taking the medication.
