   The given data indicates that the patient (p) is allergic to an ingredient (i:Oxycodone) and also takes a medication (m) containing Oxycodone. To resolve this inconsistency, we remove the allergy relationship from the patient-ingredient node pair and add a HAS_INGREDIENT relationship between the ingredient and medication nodes. We also update the ingredient and medication nodes to reflect their correct properties.
