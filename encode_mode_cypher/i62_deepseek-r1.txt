Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the problem again.

The query shows that a patient (p) takes medication (rm), which has an ingredient (m). Then there's another relationship where the patient is allergic to an ingredient (ra). But wait, in the result set, both 'rc' and 'ra' have tau_o as 0. That probably means something went wrong with those relationships.

Looking at the output details: 'rc' has "is_error": "1", which suggests that the relationship might be incorrect or invalid. On the other hand, 'ra' has an empty string for start and stop times, so maybe it's not set correctly either.

Hmm, I think the issue is that both relationships [rc] and [ra] are present but have issues with their tau_o property. Since tau_o usually represents ownership in graph databases like Neobase, setting it to 0 might mean these relationships aren't properly associated with any node. 

So, maybe we should remove these edges because they're causing inconsistencies or errors. That way, the graph won't have invalid or improperly set relationships.

I'll suggest deleting both [rc] and [ra] relationships. Each deletion will be a separate operation to keep it clear.
