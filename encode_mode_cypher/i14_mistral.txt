Explanation: The patient's birthdate is incorrect (1913-05-30), and the patient is not allergic to the ingredient as stated in the graph. To fix this, we update the patient's time attribute to 1, remove the existing allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient, and add a new allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient with a time attribute of 1.
