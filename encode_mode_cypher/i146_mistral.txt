     UPD_NODE | [p] | {"tau_o": 1}
     ADD_EDGE | [p, i] | {"type": "ALLERGIC_TO", "tau_o": 1}
   </repairs>

Explanation: The patient's `tau_o` property should be set to 1, as it is for the other nodes. Also, since there is a relationship between the patient and ingredient node that indicates an allergy (`ra`), but there is no corresponding relationship indicating non-allergy (`NOT_ALLERGIC_TO`), a new `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship should be added to reflect this inconsistency.
