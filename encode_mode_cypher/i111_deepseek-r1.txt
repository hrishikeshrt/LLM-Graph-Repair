Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the code they provided.

First, there's a match statement that connects Patient (p) to Medication (m), then to Ingredient (i). It also has another relationship from p to i via "ALLERGIC_TO". So, basically, the patient is taking medication which contains an ingredient, and the patient is allergic to that same ingredient.

Looking at the return statement, it's fetching properties for i, m, p, ra, rc, rm. The data shows that i has a tau_o of 1 and id "oxycodone". That makes sense as an ingredient. The medication m also has tau_o:1, which probably means it's active. The patient p has some info like address, birthdate, etc., but I notice something odd here.

The 'rc' relationship is between m and i with tau_o:1 and is_error:1. That seems off because medications usually have multiple ingredients, not just one error. So maybe the 'rc' edge shouldn't exist or should be adjusted to reflect that the medication has other ingredients too.

Also, looking at the 'rm' relationship, which connects p to m, it's marked with start and stop dates. But since the patient is taking only this specific medication (205923), maybe the 'rm' edge isn't necessary because there are no other medications listed. So perhaps removing 'rm' would clean up the graph.

So my plan is to remove both edges: [rc] which seems incorrect and [rm] since it's not needed if the patient only has this one medication.
