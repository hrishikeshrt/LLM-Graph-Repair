This suggests that there is a known issue with this relationship. Since no additional context is provided about what specifically is wrong, it's reasonable to assume that the relationship might be incorrect or should not exist.\n\nTo address this inconsistency, we can remove the erroneous relationship:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\n</repairs>",
