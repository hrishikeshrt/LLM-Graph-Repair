Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what's going on here.

First, looking at the query results, there are two relationships involving 'i' which is an Ingredient node with tau_o: 1. One relationship is via rm (TAKES MEDICATION) and another via rc (HAS_INGREDIENT). The problem seems to be that both these edges point to the same ingredient, but according to the data, they have different values.

Wait, let me check the details. The 'i' node has tau_o: 1 for both relationships, which might mean it's involved in two different edges. But looking at the properties of 'm', it has a code "205923" with description "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection". On the other hand, the 'rc' relationship has is_error: 1. That seems odd because if 'rc' indicates an error, maybe it shouldn't be pointing to this ingredient.

So perhaps the issue is that there are two edges connecting 'i' to different parts of the graph, but only one should exist. The 'rc' edge might not be necessary or could be incorrect in its data.

I think removing the 'rc' edge would fix the inconsistency because it's causing a conflict with another relationship on the same ingredient node. That way, each ingredient is correctly linked to one medication without duplication.
