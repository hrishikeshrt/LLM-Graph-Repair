Explanation: The medication code (860975) does not correspond to Ferrous sulfate. Therefore, we update the description of the Medication node to correctly reflect this information. Additionally, since the allergy is incorrectly associated with the Ingredient node, we update the Ingredient node's tau_o property (indicating that it is an active allergy) to ensure consistency.
