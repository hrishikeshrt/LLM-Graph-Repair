The `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship has an error flag (`is_error: \"1\"`), indicating a potential issue with the ingredient information.\n\nTo resolve this, we should address the erroneous ingredient association:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\n</repairs> \n\nThis operation removes the incorrect `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship between the medication and the ingredient. Further investigation would be needed to correctly associate the medication with its ingredients if necessary.",
