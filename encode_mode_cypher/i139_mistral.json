To fix this inconsistency, we should either remove the allergy relationship or update the patient data to indicate that they are not allergic to 'naproxen'. In this case, I have chosen to update the 'naproxen' node and remove the allergy relationship since it seems more plausible that a patient's allergy status might change over time rather than them suddenly becoming non-allergic to an ingredient they are currently taking.",
