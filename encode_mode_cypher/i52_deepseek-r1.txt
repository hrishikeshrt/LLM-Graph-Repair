Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what's going on here.

First, looking at the provided Cypher query result, there are two relationships involving 'i' which is Warfarin. One is via [rc:HAS_INGREDIENT] and another via [ra:ALLERGIC_TO]. The problem seems to be that both these relationships have empty values for their 'stop' and 'start' fields in the 'ra' relationship.

In the 'rm' relationship, Warfarin has a start date of 2013-07-05. But in the 'ra' relationship, it's marked as stop with an empty string, which doesn't make sense because if something stops, there should be a valid date. The same issue applies to the 'start' field.

So, I need to fix this by removing these invalid relationships. That means deleting both [rc] and [ra]. This will clean up the graph and prevent any inconsistencies related to Warfarin's ingredient or allergy information.
