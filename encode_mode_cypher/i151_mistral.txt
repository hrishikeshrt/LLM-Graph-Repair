   The first repair updates the patient's birthdate and deathdate to reflect that they lived until 1995. The second repair removes the allergy relationship, as it seems incorrect based on the provided data. The third repair extends the medication's end date to match the patient's deathdate. Finally, a new allergy relationship is added between the patient and ingredient nodes.
