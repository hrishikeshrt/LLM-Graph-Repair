Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the problem again.

The query returns a match where a patient takes a medication, which has an ingredient that's also their allergy. The returned data shows that the ingredient "oxycodone" is both in the medication and as an allergen for the patient. That doesn't make sense because if someone is allergic to oxycodone, they shouldn't be taking it.

Looking at the output from the query:
- The medication has a description including "1 ML Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection".
- The ingredient "oxycodone" is listed under both the medication and as an allergen for the patient.

This is clearly conflicting. An allergen shouldn't be present in a medication they're taking because it could cause severe reactions.

So, I need to remove this inconsistency. There are two options: either remove the allergy relationship or remove the ingredient from the medication.

If I delete the edge [rc] which connects the medication to the ingredient, that would take out the allergen information. But then the patient wouldn't have any allergies listed, which might be necessary for other parts of the system.

Alternatively, deleting the edge [rm] where the patient takes the medication would stop them from having an allergy to it. That seems more appropriate because if they're taking it, the allergy shouldn't exist.

I think removing the relationship between the patient and the medication is better here because it directly addresses the inconsistency without losing other important data.
