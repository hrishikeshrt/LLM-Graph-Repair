Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, there are two relationships involving the ingredient 'oxycodone'. One is through the 'rm' relationship (TAKES_MEDICATION) and another through the 'rc' relationship (HAS_INGREDIENT). 

First, looking at the medications, Epogen 4000 UNT/ML Injection seems to be a very specific and possibly incorrect name for an oxycodone medication. It's unusual because oxycodone is typically referred to as something like "Oxycodone" or "Pentoxifylline," but not with the 'UNT/ML' part. So, I think the medication name might be wrong here.

Then, looking at the allergy information on 'oxycodone', it's marked as an error (is_error: "0"), which probably means there's a problem with that data point too. Maybe oxycodone isn't actually an allergen for this patient.

So, to fix these issues, I should probably remove both relationships where the medication and allergy info are incorrect. That would mean deleting the 'rm' relationship because it incorrectly states the medication, and also deleting the 'rc' relationship because the allergy information is wrong.
