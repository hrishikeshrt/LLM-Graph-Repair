To fix this inconsistency, we update the patient node's `tau_o` property to indicate that they have taken at least one medication. Then, we add an edge between the patient and ingredient nodes with the appropriate allergen property set. This repair suggests that the patient has taken the medication but is allergic to its ingredient.",
