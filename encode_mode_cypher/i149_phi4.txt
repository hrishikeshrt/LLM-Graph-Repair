The inconsistency identified in the graph involves a medication (`m`) that has an ingredient (`i`) to which a patient (`p`) is allergic. The relationship between the medication and the ingredient (`[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(i)`) is marked with `is_error: "1"`, indicating a potential issue.

To resolve this inconsistency, we should remove the erroneous edge `[rc:HAS_INGREDIENT]` that incorrectly associates the medication with an allergenic ingredient for the patient. This operation will correct the graph by eliminating the incorrect relationship without affecting other valid data.
