Explanation: The patient (Earle679) is allergic to exemestane, but the ingested medication (HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet) does not contain exemestane as an ingredient. To fix this inconsistency, we should update the allergy information for the ingredient (exemestane) and remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the incorrect ingredient (exemestane).
