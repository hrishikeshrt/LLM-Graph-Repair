The inconsistency identified in the graph involves a patient who is allergic to an ingredient (`tau_o` property of `ra:ALLERGIC_TO` relationship) that is present in a medication they are taking (`rm:TAKES_MEDICATION`). The `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship also has an error flag set (`is_error`: "1"), indicating a potential issue with the ingredient's inclusion in the medication.

To resolve this inconsistency, we need to address both the allergy and the erroneous ingredient information. Here are the suggested repairs:

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {"tau_o": 0}
</repairs>

<repairs>
UPD_EDGE | [rc] | {"is_error": "0"}
