Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me go through it step by step.

First, looking at the provided code, there are two relationships from the patient node: one is `rm:TAKES_MEDICATION` pointing to medication `m`, and another `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT` pointing to ingredient `i`. Additionally, there's a relationship `ra:ALLERGIC_TO` between the patient and the ingredient.

Wait, that last part seems off. If the patient has an allergy to an ingredient, shouldn't it be represented directly on the ingredient node? But here, it's connected through the patient. That might not make sense because allergies are typically properties of the ingredient itself.

So, I think the issue is with how `ra:ALLERGIC_TO` is set up. It should probably be a property on the `i` node instead of linking to the patient again. This way, it's more accurate and avoids creating an unnecessary relationship that might confuse the system.

To fix this, I'll need to remove the existing `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship because the ingredient already has its own properties like `code`, which includes the medication name. Then, instead of having both `rc` and `ra`, I should add a property on the `i` node indicating the allergy.

So, first, delete the `rc` edge between `p` and `i`. Second, update the `i` node to include an `allergies` property with the value "mestranol". This way, all relevant information is correctly linked without redundant relationships.
