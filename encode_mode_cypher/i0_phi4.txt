The inconsistency identified in the graph data involves a patient who is taking medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic. Specifically, the patient "Donn979 Casper496" is taking amoxicillin, which contains the ingredient "amoxicillin," and there is an existing relationship indicating the patient is allergic to this ingredient.

To resolve this inconsistency, we should remove the relationship indicating the patient is allergic to the ingredient present in their medication. This can be achieved by deleting the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient.
