Explanation: The patient "Boyd" is allergic to the ingredient "mestranol", but the medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" does not contain "mestranol". To fix this inconsistency, we update the property `tau_o` of the node "i" (Ingredient) to indicate that it is an allergen for the patient. Then, we remove the relationship between the patient and the ingredient since the medication does not contain the allergen.
