   The first repair updates the patient's time of birth to be consistent with the other properties. The second repair sets a start date for the allergy relationship and keeps the stop date as it was, assuming that the patient had an allergy before the medication intake. The third repair adds a new edge between the patient and ingredient nodes to reflect the allergy relationship.
