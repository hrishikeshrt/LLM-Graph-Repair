The patient is allergic to the active ingredient of the medication, but the graph shows that they are allergic to the entire medication. To fix this inconsistency, we update the allergy node (i) with a new timestamp and add an edge between the medication node (m) and the updated allergy node (i), indicating that the allergy is to an inactive ingredient.
