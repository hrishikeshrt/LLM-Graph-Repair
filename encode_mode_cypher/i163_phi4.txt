The inconsistency identified in the graph involves a patient being allergic to an ingredient (`tau_o` value of `1`) that is part of a medication they are taking. This situation suggests a potential error, as it would be unusual for a patient to take a medication containing an allergen unless there is some specific medical oversight or mislabeling.

To resolve this inconsistency, we should address the erroneous relationship indicating the allergy:

This operation removes the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship between the patient and the ingredient, assuming that the medication intake is correct and the allergy information is incorrect. If further investigation reveals that the medication should indeed be avoided due to an allergy, additional context or medical data would be necessary for a more informed decision.
