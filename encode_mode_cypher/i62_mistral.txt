The patient (Sanford861) is allergic to "ferrous sulfate", but the medication they take does not contain this ingredient. To fix this inconsistency, we update the property `tau_o` of the Ingredient node with id "ferrous sulfate" to 0, indicating it is no longer an allergen for the patient. We also remove the relationship between the Patient and Ingredient nodes, as the patient is no longer allergic to this ingredient.
