Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the description provided.

The query matches a patient taking medication, which has an ingredient relationship. There's also an allergic_to relationship between the patient and the ingredient. The returned data shows that the 'ra' (allergic_to) relationship has empty start and stop times, but it exists with tau_o 0. That probably means something is wrong here because if there's a relationship, it should have some properties filled.

Looking at the 'rc' (has_ingredient) relationship, it correctly points to Oxycodone with an error code of 1. But in the 'ra' case, since start and stop are empty, maybe that's causing issues. So I think we need to update the 'ra' relationship to have valid dates or remove it if necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'rc' should point to both Epogen and Oxycodone because the patient is taking medication with an ingredient that has an allergy. That might make sense too. But in this case, the main issue seems to be with the 'ra' relationship having incomplete information.

So I'll suggest either updating the 'ra' relationship by setting start and stop dates or removing it if it's not applicable anymore.
