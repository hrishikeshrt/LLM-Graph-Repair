Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

The query returns some relationships between a patient, medication, and ingredients. Specifically, it looks at whether the patient has an allergic reaction or takes certain medications. The returned data includes details about each node involved.

Looking at the output, I notice that for the 'rc' relationship (HAS_INGREDIENT), there's an error indicated by `is_error: "0"` and a status code of 1. That seems off because usually, if it's an error, maybe it should be something else or perhaps removed entirely.

So, first thought: Maybe this 'rc' edge is incorrect. Perhaps the relationship shouldn't exist at all. If I delete that edge, it would fix the inconsistency where the medication has no ingredients listed correctly.

Also, looking at the 'rm' relationship (TAKES_MEDICATION), there's a start and stop time. The stop time is set to an empty string, which doesn't make sense. That might be another issue. If the medication was taken until 2002-08-25, then setting the stop date to null or removing it would correct that.

So, my plan is to remove both the 'rc' and 'rm' edges because their statuses are problematic. This should eliminate the inconsistencies in the data.
