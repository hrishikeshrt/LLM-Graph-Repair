Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the description given.

The query matches a patient taking medication, which has an ingredient relationship. It also connects the patient to an ingredient via "ALLERGIC_TO". The result shows that the 'ra' relationship (which is supposed to be "ALLERGIC_TO") has a stop date of an empty string and an is_error value of 1. On the other hand, the 'rc' (which should be "HAS_INGREDIENT") has an is_error of 0.

Hmm, so it looks like there's inconsistency in how these relationships are being handled. The 'ra' relationship isn't correctly set because its stop date and error status indicate a problem, while 'rc' seems fine. 

I think the issue here is that both 'rm' (medication) and 'rc' (ingredient) have the correct properties except for their error statuses. But since they're part of separate relationships from the patient to medication and ingredient respectively, maybe we need to address each separately.

So, perhaps I should remove the incorrect 'ra' relationship because it's marked as an error, while adding the correct 'rc' relationship if it's missing or needs correction. That way, both relationships are accurately represented without errors.
