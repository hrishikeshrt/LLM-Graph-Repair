Explanation: The Ingredient node with id "oxycodone" does not exist in the graph. To fix this inconsistency, we first update the Allergy relationship to remove the incorrect ingredient association (`ra`). Then, we add a new Ingredient node with an updated id that does not conflict with existing nodes (e.g., "-").
