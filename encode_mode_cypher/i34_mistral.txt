The reason for the suggested repairs is that the Ingredient node with id "oxycodone" does not exist in the graph. Therefore, we delete the allergy relationship and create a new Ingredient node with the correct id "oxycodone". Then, we add an edge between the new Ingredient node and the Medication node to establish the correct HAS_INGREDIENT relationship.
