The inconsistency identified in the graph is that a patient (`p`) who is allergic to an ingredient (`i`) is also taking medication (`m`) that contains this allergen. This situation poses a health risk and should be addressed.

To resolve this, we can either:
1. Remove the relationship indicating the patient takes the medication.
2. Correct the allergy information if it's incorrect (though there's no indication of an error in the allergy data).

Given the information provided, the most straightforward repair is to remove the relationship that indicates the patient takes the medication containing the allergen.
