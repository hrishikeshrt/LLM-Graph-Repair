Explanation: The medication's description is incorrect, and the ingredient's name seems to be inconsistent with the one provided in the Medication node. To fix this, we update the Ingredient node's `tau_o` property (since it appears to be a unique identifier) and the Medication node's description. No additional operations are necessary for this specific case as the reported relationships between nodes seem correct.
