The patient (Isiah Fritsch) is not allergic to the ingredient (ferrous sulfate), but the graph suggests that he is. To fix this inconsistency, we remove the existing allergy edge and add a new allergy edge between the patient and the correct ingredient. Additionally, since the ingredient information for ferrous sulfate has an incorrect `tau_o` value (1), it should be updated to match the original value of 0.
