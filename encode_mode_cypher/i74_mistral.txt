The patient's birthdate and other personal details are correct in the provided data. However, the allergy information (edge `[ra]`) seems to be inconsistent since the patient is taking a medication that they are also allergic to. To fix this, we update the properties of the affected nodes (patient and allergy edge) to reflect an absence of an allergy to the specific ingredient.
