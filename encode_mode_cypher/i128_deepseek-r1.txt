Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what's going on here.

Looking at the provided Cypher query result, there are two relationships involving the ingredient 'oxycodone'. The first is through `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT` and the second through `ra:ALLERGIC_TO`. Wait, that can't be right because a medication shouldn't have an ingredient listed as both taken and also as an allergen. That's conflicting.

So, I need to decide which relationship to keep. If we remove the `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship, then 'oxycodone' will only be associated with the allergy. Alternatively, if we remove the `ra:ALLERGIC_TO`, then it won't show up as an allergen, but that might not make sense either.

I think removing the `rc` edge makes more sense because having a medication with an ingredient listed under 'HAS_INGREDIENT' and also marked as an allergen seems contradictory. Medications usually have ingredients, but being an allergen is separate unless specified in the data model.

So, I'll suggest deleting the `rc` relationship to fix this inconsistency.
