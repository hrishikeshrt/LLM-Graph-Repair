Explanation: The patient (Earle679) is allergic to the ingredient "mestranol", but this medication (Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension) does not contain mestranol as an ingredient. To fix this inconsistency, we need to update the property of the ingredient node to reflect a different allergen and remove the incorrect relationship between the patient and the ingredient.
