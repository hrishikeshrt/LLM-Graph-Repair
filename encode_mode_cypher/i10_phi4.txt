The inconsistency identified in the graph involves a patient (`p`) who is both taking a medication (`m`) that contains an ingredient (`i`) and being allergic to that same ingredient. This situation suggests a potential error in the relationships or properties.

To address this, we can consider removing the relationship indicating the allergy if it's incorrect due to data entry errors or misinterpretation of medical records. Alternatively, if the medication should not contain the allergen, we might need to remove the relationship between the medication and the ingredient.
