   The patient is allergic to epoetin alfa, but the allergy relationship (ra) is not present. Instead, it has an incorrect medication allergy relationship. To fix this, we remove the incorrect allergy relationship and update the patient's tau_k property to include "epoetin alfa". Additionally, the TAKES_MEDICATION relationship (rm) should have a start date but no stop date, so we update it accordingly.
