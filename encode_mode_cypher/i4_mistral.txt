Explanation: The patient is allergic to exemestane (Ingredient node), but there's no edge connecting the Patient and Ingredient nodes with the 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship. To fix this, we update the Ingredient node's 'tau_o' property to 1 (indicating it is an active allergy) and delete the existing 'ra' edge between the patient and ingredient. Then, we add a new edge connecting the Patient and Ingredient nodes with the 'ALLERGIC_TO' relationship and set its 'tau_o' property to 1 as well.
