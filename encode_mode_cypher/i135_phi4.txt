The inconsistency identified in the graph query involves a medication (`m`) that has an incorrect description and contains an ingredient (`i`) to which the patient (`p`) is allergic. The medication "Humulin 70/30 Injectable Suspension" does not logically contain "mestranol" as an ingredient, indicating either the relationship or the properties are incorrect.

To resolve this inconsistency:

1. Remove the incorrect relationship between the medication and the ingredient.
2. Update the description of the medication if necessary to reflect its actual contents.

Here's how you can address these issues with graph operations:

<repairs>
DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
UPD_NODE | m | {"description": "Corrected Medication Description"}
</repairs> 

Note: The specific corrected description for the medication should be determined based on accurate data sources or domain knowledge.
