Explanation: The patient Logan497 is allergic to oxycodone (as per the returned data), but there's no node for oxycodone in the graph. Therefore, we need to add a new node for oxycodone and update the relationship between the patient and the ingredient to reflect the allergy correctly. We also remove the incorrect edge between the patient and oxycodone (ingredient of medication) since it is factually inconsistent with the allergy information.
