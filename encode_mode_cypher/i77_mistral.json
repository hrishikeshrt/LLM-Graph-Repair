The second repair operation modifies the allergy relationship's start and stop attributes to reflect that the patient was allergic to the ingredient from the start date until their deathdate. This correction assumes that the patient had an allergy to the ingredient before 1970-06-26T09:30:42Z, which is indicated by the presence of the ra relationship in the returned results.",
