Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

Looking at the provided code, there are two relationships from the patient (p) to medication (m) and then to ingredient (i). The first relationship is TAKES_MEDICATION with stop date 2005-07-22 and start date 2005-06-17. Then, there's another relationship HAS_INGREDIENT from m to i without any dates.

Wait a minute, the problem might be that both medication relationships are pointing directly to the ingredient without considering if they're related through time or dosage. Maybe the first medication (Coumadin) is taken until 2005-07-22 and has an ingredient warfarin which starts at some point but isn't specified here.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship doesn't have a start date, making it unclear when the ingredient was present. Also, since both relationships go from m to i, maybe they should be separate or adjusted for clarity.

So, I think we need to add a stop date to the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship so that it's clear when the ingredient is no longer present. That would make sense because if it doesn't have a start and end date, it's hard to track.

I'll suggest adding the stop date to [rc] with "2005-07-22T20:51:21Z" so that both HAS_INGREDIENT relationships (from m to i) now have their stop dates set. This way, the graph accurately reflects when each ingredient is present.
