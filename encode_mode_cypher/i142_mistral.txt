The patient's time of birth was not set to 1. So we update the node 'p'. Also, the patient is not currently allergic to any ingredient, but in the given data, they are allergic to 'olmesartan'. Therefore, we add a new edge between 'p' and 'i', indicating that the patient is allergic to 'olmesartan'.
