Explanation: The patient is not allergic to the ingredient of the medication they are taking. To fix this inconsistency, we update the patient node's `tau_o` property to indicate that it has an allergy (`{tau_o: 1}`). Then, we add a new edge between the patient and the ingredient node indicating their allergy relationship.
