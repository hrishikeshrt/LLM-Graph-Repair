Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the description provided.

First, there's a match statement that connects a Patient (p) to a Medication (m), then to an Ingredient (i). There are two relationships: rm is TAKES_MEDICATION and rc is HAS_INGREDIENT. Additionally, p has a relationship ra which is ALLERGIC_TO connecting back to i.

The returned data shows that the ingredient 'oxycodone' is present with tau_o as 1, but the medication also lists 'Epogen' with the same tau_o of 1. That seems like an issue because Epogen and Oxycodone are different substances. So, having both in the same medication might be incorrect.

Looking at the relationships, rm has a start and stop date set to "2014-04-17T09:55:43Z", but rc's tau_o is 1 while Epogen's tau_o is also 1. This suggests that both are present in the medication.

I think the problem here is that the medication has two different ingredients, which isn't allowed. So, I should remove one of them. Since 'Epogen' might be more critical or correct, perhaps removing 'Oxycodone' would fix it.

To do this, I can delete the edge [rc] pointing to 'oxycodone'. That way, only Epogen remains in the medication.
