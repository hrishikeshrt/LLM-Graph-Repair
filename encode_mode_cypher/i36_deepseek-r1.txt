Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the description provided.

The query matches a patient taking medication and has an ingredient relationship. But there's also a `ra:ALLERGIC_TO` relationship pointing directly from the patient to the ingredient. The returned data shows that for the ingredient "clopidogrel", the allergy status is marked as stop with empty values for start, which doesn't make sense because if it's stopped, there should be a valid date range.

Hmm, so maybe the issue is that the `ALLERGIC_TO` relationship isn't correctly capturing when the allergy was started or ended. The current data shows "start" and "stop" as empty strings, but since it's marked as "stop", those fields should have actual values indicating when the allergy was discontinued.

I think adding a new edge for the `START_ALLERGIC_TO` relationship would make sense here. This way, we can set the start date correctly, which is missing in the current setup. So I'll add an edge from the patient to the ingredient with the property "start" having the value "2008-04-11T09:55:43Z". That should fix the inconsistency by providing accurate information about when the allergy started.

I don't think we need to remove any edges or update existing ones beyond this addition because the other relationships seem fine. The medication and its start date are correctly set, so no changes are needed there.
