This suggests a potential issue with the ingredient information for the medication. Since the patient is also allergic to this ingredient, it's important to ensure the integrity of the ingredient data.\n\nTo address this inconsistency, we should remove the erroneous relationship between the medication and the ingredient:\n\n<repairs>\nDEL_EDGE | [rc] | -\n</repairs>",
