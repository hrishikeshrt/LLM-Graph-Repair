Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

Looking at the provided code, there are two relationships: rm and rc. The rm relationship has a stop date of "1990-01-08T05:08:34Z", which means it stops on that date. But for the rc relationship, the stop date is an empty string. 

Hmm, I think the issue here is that both relationships should have consistent properties. The rm relation has a start and stop time, but rc only has tau_o set to 1 and is_error as "1". Wait, no, looking again, rc's details show {"tau_o": 1, "is_error": "0"}. So maybe the problem isn't with the presence of properties but their values.

Wait, in the example output, they suggested removing the rm relationship. But why? Because rm has a stop date, which might indicate it's no longer valid or applicable after that date. Maybe the rc relationship is supposed to have an error status instead of just having tau_o set to 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the rc relationship should also be updated to reflect some kind of error since the stop date is empty. Or maybe rm shouldn't exist because rc has a more accurate status.

I think the main issue is that both relationships are pointing from p to i and m to i via different properties. Maybe the rm (TAKES_MEDICATION) relationship should be removed because it's no longer valid, and instead, the rc (HAS_INGREDIENT) should have the correct details.

So, I'll suggest removing the rm edge since it has a stop date that might indicate it's outdated or incorrect. Then, maybe update the rc edge to include more accurate information like is_error being "1" if there's an issue with the ingredient.
