   ADD_EDGE | [i]-[:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(m)
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the Ingredient node's `tau_o` property to 1 and adding a relationship between the Ingredient node and the Medication node using the HAS_INGREDIENT relationship. This repair corrects the inconsistency where the Ingredient node is both an ingredient of the medication and an allergy for the patient, which is not factually accurate.
