Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let's see what the problem is.

First, looking at the match statement, it connects a patient (p) to a medication (m), which then connects to an ingredient (i). There's also another relationship from p to i via "ALLERGIC_TO". The issue seems to be with the relationships involving the ingredient.

In the result set provided, I notice that both [rc] and [rm] have issues. Specifically, [rc] has an "is_error" value of 1, which probably means there's a problem with that relationship. Also, [rm] has "start" as empty but "stop" is set to a specific date.

So, the first thing I think about is whether these relationships should exist or not. If [rc] is marked as an error, maybe it shouldn't be in the graph anymore. That would mean deleting the [rc] relationship.

Next, looking at [rm], which connects medication (m) to ingredient (i), it has a "start" date but no "stop". This might indicate that this relationship isn't complete or is meant to continue indefinitely. Perhaps we should set "stop" to null or remove it if the medication doesn't expire.

So, my plan is to delete the [rc] relationship because of the error and adjust the [rm] by setting its stop date appropriately.

DEL_EDGE | [rc] | -
UPD_EDGE | [rm] | {"stop": null}
