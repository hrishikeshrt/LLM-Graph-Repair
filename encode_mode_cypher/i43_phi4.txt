The inconsistency identified in the graph involves a patient who is allergic to an ingredient (`ra:ALLERGIC_TO`) that is present in a medication they are taking (`rm:TAKES_MEDICATION`). The relationship `ra` has `is_error` set to "1", indicating there might be an error or issue with this allergy information.

To resolve the inconsistency, we should remove the incorrect allergy relationship. This ensures that the patient's medical records accurately reflect their allergies without conflicting with their current medication regimen.
