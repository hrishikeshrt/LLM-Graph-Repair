Explanation: The patient is allergic to an ingredient (mestranol) that they are also taking as medication. This is inconsistent because a person cannot be allergic to something they are currently taking. To resolve this, we update the ingredient node's `tau_o` property to indicate it was once used but not currently, and then remove the allergy relationship between the patient and the ingredient.
