The inconsistency identified in the graph involves a patient who is taking a medication that contains an ingredient to which they are allergic. Specifically, the patient "Sanford861 Fritsch593" is taking a medication containing "oxycodone," but is also allergic to "oxycodone." The relationship `rc:HAS_INGREDIENT` has an `is_error` property set to `"1"`, indicating that there might be an error in this relationship.

To resolve this inconsistency, the logical step would be to remove or correct the erroneous ingredient relationship. Since the allergy is a critical health concern, it's safer to assume that the patient should not take medications containing ingredients they are allergic to. Therefore, removing the incorrect `HAS_INGREDIENT` relationship seems appropriate unless further information suggests otherwise.
