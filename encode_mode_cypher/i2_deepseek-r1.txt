Alright, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, we have a graph query that returns some relationships between patients, medications, and ingredients. The issue seems to be with the 'rm' relationship which has an 'id' value of "exemestane" but also mentions "HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet". That doesn't make much sense because HCTZ is a different medication.

First, I think we need to remove the incorrect part from the 'rm' relationship. Maybe we should delete the part where it says "HCTZ 25 MG Oral Tablet" so that only the correct ID remains. That would involve using `DEL_EDGE` on the 'rm' relationship and specifying which property is causing the issue, which in this case is the 'description'.

So, the plan is to apply a deletion operation on the edge labeled 'rm', targeting the specific part of its properties that's incorrect. This should clean up the data and leave only the accurate information intact.
