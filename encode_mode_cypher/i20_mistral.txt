      UPD_NODE | [i] | {"tau_o": 1, "id": "-"}
      ADD_EDGE | [p]-[:ALLERGIC_TO]->(i:Ingredient) | {"tau_o": 0, "id": "oxycodone", "tau_o": 1}
   </repairs>

This repair suggests updating the Ingredient node with a different ID and adding an ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the Patient node and the updated Ingredient node. The new ID for the Ingredient should be unique to avoid further inconsistencies.
