   UPD_NODE | [i] | {"tau_o": 1}
   ADD_EDGE | [i]-[:HAS_INGREDIENT]->(m)
   </repairs>

Explanation: The Ingredient node (ferrous sulfate) has a tau_o value of 1, but it should not have this property as it is not a medication. To fix the inconsistency, we remove the relationship between the Patient and the Ingredient node (allergy), add a new relationship between the Ingredient and Medication nodes (ingredient), and update the tau_o value of the Ingredient node to 0, as it should not have this property.
