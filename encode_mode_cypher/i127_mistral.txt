Explanation: The patient is allergic to the ingredient "oxycodone", but the node with id "oxycodone" does not exist in the graph. First, we update the non-existent ingredient node with an empty tau_o value and remove the incorrect allergy relationship from the patient node. This repair assumes that there is no other node with the same id as "oxycodone". If there is such a node, it should be checked for consistency before applying this repair.
