Explanation: The patient's birthdate is earlier than the start date of the medication they are taking, suggesting that the allergy information might be incorrect. To fix this inconsistency, we update the patient's time-unit property (tau_o) to 1 and add a new ALLERGIC_TO relationship between the patient and the ingredient node. Additionally, we modify the ingredient node's id and tau_k properties to reflect that it is an allergen for the patient.
