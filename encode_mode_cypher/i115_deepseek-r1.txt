Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in a graph. Let me start by looking at the query and the results.

The query matches a patient (p) who takes medication (rm), which is associated with a medication (m). This medication has an ingredient (i) through HAS_INGREDIENT, and there's also an ALLERGIC_TO relationship between p and i.

Looking at the result, I see that the 'rc' edge from m to i has {tau_o: 1} but {is_error: 1}. That probably means it's marked as an error. The 'rm' edge doesn't have any issues there. The patient (p) has some properties like address and birthdate, which seems fine.

So the main problem is with the 'rc' edge because it's indicating an error even though the medication does have an ingredient. I think we should remove this error mark so that the graph reflects the correct data.
