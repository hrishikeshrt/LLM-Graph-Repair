Explanation:
The patient is taking exemestane (which is an ingredient in the medication), but it's also listed as an allergy for the patient. This contradicts the fact that the patient can take the medication if they are not allergic to its ingredients. To fix this, we remove the allergy edge and update the patient node to include exemestane in their list of known allergies (tau_k). Additionally, the start date of the takes_medication relationship is corrected from 2016-09-26T13:57:11Z to 2016-09-30T13:57:11Z since we assume that it should be at least a few days after the allergy was recorded (2016-10-03T13:57:11Z).
