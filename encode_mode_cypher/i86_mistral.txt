Explanation: The patient's birthdate (1914) is before the reported start date of their allergy to Ingredient i (1978). To fix this inconsistency, we update the patient node's tau_o property to 1 and modify the ra edge's start property to a later date. No changes are made to the medication or ingredient nodes as the reported data for these entities seems correct.
