The patient (p) is allergic to an ingredient (i), but the medication (m) they take does not contain this allergen. To fix this inconsistency, we remove the allergy relationship (`ra`) and update the ingredient node (`i`) to have a non-zero `tau_o` value, indicating that it is an active or current entity in the graph.
