   The patient's birthdate should be updated to 1, and the medication's start time for the relationship should remain as it is, but the stop time should be removed. This repair assumes that the patient was indeed taking the medication until at least the given date (1976-08-23T09:30:42Z). If this assumption is incorrect, further repairs may be necessary.
