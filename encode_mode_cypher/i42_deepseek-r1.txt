Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this inconsistency. So, from what I understand, there are two relationships involving 'i' which stands for Ingredient. One is through 'rc: HAS_INGREDIENT' and the other is directly connected to 'i'. The problem here seems to be that both relationships have their own properties set.

First, looking at the 'rc' relationship, it has a property called 'tau_o' with a value of 1 and 'is_error' as "1". But in the 'i' node's details, I don't see these properties listed. That might mean there's an inconsistency because one source says something is wrong (is_error:1) while another doesn't mention it.

Next, the 'rm' relationship has 'tau_o' set to 0 and a 'start' date. But in the 'i' node details, I don't see these either. So maybe this information isn't correctly associated with that ingredient.

I think the best approach is to remove both relationships involving 'i'. That way, we eliminate the conflicting data without having to update all the properties, which might be complicated and could introduce more issues.
