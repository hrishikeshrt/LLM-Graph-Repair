Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me look at the query and the results.

The query matches a patient taking medication, which has an ingredient relationship, and also links the patient to an ingredient via an allergy. The returned data shows that there's an "rc" relationship with `tau_o` set to 1 and `is_error` as 1. That probably means something is wrong with this edge.

Looking at the output from the query, the "rc" has `is_error: '1'`, which suggests it's an error edge or maybe a placeholder indicating an issue. So I think we need to remove this relationship because it's causing inconsistency.

So the plan is to delete the `rc` relationship since its status isn't correct. That should fix the inconsistency in the graph.
