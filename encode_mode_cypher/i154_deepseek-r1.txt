Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

Looking at the query result, there are two relationships: rm and rc. The rm relationship has a stop date of "1999-03-13T06:11:10Z", which means it stopped on that date. But the rc relationship doesn't have any stop or start dates listed; they're just empty strings.

Hmm, so for the rc relationship between medication and ingredient, both the start and stop times are missing. That's probably causing an issue because if those relationships aren't properly defined, it might affect how the data is queried or displayed elsewhere in the system.

I need to decide whether to remove these relationships or update them with default values. Since the stop dates for rm were provided but rc isn't, maybe it's better to add default values so that all edges have consistent information. This way, when someone queries the graph, they'll know when each relationship started and ended, even if the specific details aren't available.

So, I'll go with adding default start and stop times for both rm and rc relationships. For the start time, "1998-10-17T06:11:10Z" seems to be when rm stopped, so maybe that's a good default for when rc started as well. The stop date can remain empty if it wasn't provided.

By adding these defaults, all relationships will have both start and stop times defined, which should fix the inconsistency without needing to remove any edges.
