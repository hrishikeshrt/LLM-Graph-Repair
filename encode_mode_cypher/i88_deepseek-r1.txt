Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this inconsistency in the graph. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The query matches a patient taking medication, which has an ingredient relationship. Then it also matches the patient being allergic to an ingredient. The problem is that the allergy information seems incorrect because "epoetin alfa" isn't typically an allergen. 

Looking at the provided data, the 'ra' relationship for 'epoetin alfa' has a 'stop' value of an empty string and a 'start' date as 1968-12-27T09:30:42Z. Also, there's no 'tau_o' or other relevant properties set here.

So the issue is that the allergy relationship isn't correctly defined because it doesn't have necessary properties like 'is_error', which should be true since this allergy shouldn't exist. 

To fix this, I need to add these missing properties for the 'ra' relationship. Specifically, setting 'is_error' to "1" and ensuring other relevant fields are properly set.

I'll use an UPD_EDGE operation on the 'ra' relationship to update its properties.

UPD_EDGE | [ra] | {is_error: 1}
